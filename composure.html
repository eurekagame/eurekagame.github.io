      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

 <h2><a href="index.html#composure" class="keyword-link">Composure</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Composure</strong> could be considered something like 'emotional HP'. It tracks stress, fear, fatigue, and other 
        things that wear on the body and mind without causing physical injury. All investigators have a maximum of 
        7 Composure Points, but how easily they lose them depends on the individual.</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p><em>When an investigator is confronted with anything threatening, exceptionally stressful, or otherwise disturbing, 
        they must make a Composure roll.</em> A Composure roll will have a Contextual modifier depending on the character's 
        Tiers of Fear. If the total modifier is a -3 or worse, the investigator takes 1 extra Composure damage if the roll 
        is anything but a Full Success.</p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: No Composure loss, even if the modifier was -3 or worse. </p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: 1 Composure loss. If the modifier was -3 or worse, this is increased to 2.</p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: 2 Composure loss. If the modifier was -3 or worse, this is increased to 3 Composure damage</p>            
    </div>
    <p>Composure loss beyond zero rolls over into Superficial Damage. The Superficial Damage that results from Composure loss 
        is not reduced by armor or any other item or ability </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p>As investigators lose their Composure, well, they start to lose their composure. Composure “caps” Base Modifiers on rolls. 
            <em>The sum of penalties and Base modifiers on any given roll cannot be higher than an investigator's current Composure. 
            Contextual modifiers, however, are not affected by Composure.</em></p>
<h3>Tiers of Fear</h3>
    <p>The modifier for any given <strong>Composure roll</strong> is determined by the investigator's <strong>Tiers of Fear</strong>, a chart found on their character 
        sheet which ranks the way an investigator feels about certain fears and tense situations, from “Horrific” to “Ridiculous.” 
        Fears which are rated at the “Ridiculous” tier don't always need to prompt a Composure Roll.</p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p>What is “Horrific” and what is “Ridiculous” varies from person to person. An adventurous whip-swinging college professor who brawls with Nazis 
     might consider a fistfight Ridiculous, but any kind of snake is firmly in the realm of Horrific.</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>A Composure Roll Modifier may be raised by +2 (and thus less likely to cause Composure loss) by some element of reassurance or comfort. 
        Similarly, if there is some element that would make the source of fear more frightening or more intense, decrease the 
        Composure Roll Modifier by -2.</p>
<h3>Composure in Combat</h3>
    <p><em>When an investigator is threatened with or engages in violence, they must immediately make a Composure Roll based on the relevant 
            kind of violence after the situation has resolved.</em>Investigators need only make one Composure roll after a confrontation, and it 
            should be based on the most severe option on their Tiers of Fear. Additionally, investigators must make relevant Composure Rolls each 
            time they take damage from combat. </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
         <p>Players are encouraged to portray their investigators as noticeably more and more nervous and on-edge as the Composure 
            counter ticks down. When Composure reaches 0, these behaviors may become more extreme - the investigator has completely 
            lost their composure. This may look like lashing out at their friends, fleeing in a panic, freezing like a deer in headlights, 
            or even just buying a pack of smokes for the first time in years.</p>
    <h2>Regaining Composure</h2>
        <p>Composure can be regained by investigators in a variety of ways, but the most reliable ways will be succeeding at Comfort Rolls and meeting their basic needs. 
            The ways investigators can regain Composure are as follows:</p>
        <div class="inset-box">
            <p><strong>Eating three meals in a day</strong>: 1 Composure restored (after eating the third meal)</p>
            <p><strong>8 hours of sleep</strong>: 1 Composure restored (after the eighth hour of sleep).</p>
            <p><strong>Eureka! Moment</strong>: Investigators gain 1 point of Composure each time they spend a Eureka! Point to retroactively succeed on an Investigation Roll.</p>
            <p><strong>Comfort Roll</strong>: The Comfort Skill can also be used to restore Composure to fellow investigators. Investigators cannot use Comfort rolls on themselves.</p>
        </div>
    <h3><a href="index.html#comfort-rolls" class="keyword-link">The Comfort Roll</a></h3>
        <p>In order to make a <strong>Comfort roll</strong>, the investigators must actually have a bit of dialogue together or some 
            other action (like a hug) that would reasonably reassure or calm the investigator being comforted. Characters may only 
            make this type of Comfort roll on a given investigator once per Scene. <em>Once an investigator has regained Composure from 
            a Comfort roll, they must lose a point of Composure before another Comfort roll can be made on them.</em></p>
        <div class="inset-box">
            <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: 2 Composure restored.</p>
            <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: 1 Composure restored.</p>
            <p><strong>Failure</strong>: No Composure restored.</p>
        </div>
         <p>A Comfort roll need not be intentional on the part of the character making the roll - if an investigator would reasonably feel 
            reassured or calmed by a character's actions, then the player of that investigator can declare that those actions warrant a Comfort roll.</p>
    <h3>Meeting Basic Needs</h3>
        <p>When investigators fail to meet their basic needs, such as food and sleep, this results in flat Composure loss. </p>
         <div class="inset-box">
            <p><strong>Skipping a meal (up to three times every 24 hours)</strong>: -1 Composure.</p>
            <p><strong>Going without shelter for 24 hours</strong>: -1 Composure.</p>
            <p><strong>Less than 8 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period</strong>: -1 Composure.</p>
            <p><strong>No sleep at all in a 24 hour period</strong>: -4 Composure.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Food is not free. An investigator will need to make a <strong>Wealth Roll</strong> when they want to eat a meal to see if they can afford it.
            Investigators may also buy food for other characters, offering to cook them a meal at home or foot the bill at a restaurant,
            which incurs a -1 penalty to their Wealth Roll for each additional person. </p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
            <p>Affording food is consequently something even very poor investigators have a good chance of succeeding at. When rolling 
            the Wealth skill to buy a meal, add a +2 Contextual modifier. If an investigator is eating at home, they may eat there instead 
            of going out. If they do, there is an additional +2 Contextual modifier (so +4 total).</p>
        <div class="inset-box">
            <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: They will be able to get food anywhere with no hassle.</p>
            <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: They are able to obtain food, but with a catch:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>They can eat “good food” which is filling and healthy, but must make a Poverty Composure roll.</li>
                    <li>They can eat cheap, nasty food, or just a small snack that is barely enough calories to count as a 
                        meal. Either way, this confers a -1 penalty to all Physical skills until the time they eat their next meal.</li>
                </ul>
            <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The investigator cannot afford a meal.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Having such specific rules for the buying and eating of food means devoting session time to Scenes of characters eating, 
            and this is by design. Meal scenes are very important to the mystery genre. Many meal scenes will be a single sentence and roll. 
            Ex. "“Harriet snacks on a pickle for breakfast while she gets ready to head out and meet the rest of the party."</p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p>However, a group of investigators eating together provides opportunities. Investigators won't just sit silently when they 
            eat together, they'll have conversations, compare notes, discuss theories, make plans, and learn more about each other. They 
            might make new <strong>Investigation Rolls</strong> to put pieces together, or make <strong>Comfort Rolls</strong> to regain Composure.</p>
<h2>Ticks</h2>
    <p>The mystery genre often benefits from a "Ticking Clock", with characters under pressure to solve a mystery quickly before things escalate. 
        A GM might prepare certain developments in the mystery occurring at particular times. When using the Ticking Clock, time is 
        measured in “Ticks” instead of trying to simulate the passage of actual hours and minutes. <em>Ticks are a story-centric form of time-management, 
        and they do not pass arbitrarily, but are also abstractions: One Tick is not equivalent to any specific unit of time.</em></p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>By default, regardless of the actual in-game time expended, any Scene takes one Tick. Days and nights are each comprised of a clock of 10 Ticks. 
        (A full day has 20 Ticks total.) Ticks are cumulatively shared by the whole investigative party. Investigators may split up from each other 
        to accomplish multiple Scenes within the same Tick, but all the rules below still apply</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>Any time a Failure or Partial Success results in a consequence of extra time spent on an action, advance the clock by one additional 
        Tick for that Scene, even if the additional time is just a few minutes.</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>Combat in Eureka tends to be over in a matter of real-time seconds. Regardless, when time starts being measured in Turns, 1 Tick is consumed 
        for every 5 Rounds that lasts, rounding down. An instance of combat in Eureka is very unlikely to last more than 4 Rounds.</p>
    <h3>Ticks and Basic Needs</h3>
        <p>When using the Ticking Clock, needing to set time aside for sleeping and eating can become even more stressful</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p><strong>Eating</strong>: Investigators must spend at least 3 Scenes per day eating food, or they will not gain a Composure Point at 
            the end of the day for eating three meals a day. Note that this says “3 Scenes,” not “3 Ticks.” </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p><strong>Sleeping</strong>: Investigators must individually spend at least 5 Ticks sleeping per day, or they will not gain a Composure Point 
            from being well-rested. If they spend less than 5 Ticks sleeping, they will lose 1 point of Composure. If they spend less than 2, they 
            lose 4 points of Composure.</p>
<div class="para-break"></div> 
        <p>Finally, most investigators are ordinary people, and many of them will thus have jobs. Investigators with jobs will need to spend 5 
            Ticks per day working, and make travel rolls to commute each way, leaving them very little time to solve the mystery. <em>Players should 
            consider this during character creation.</em> Does your character do their investigating on weekends? Take long lunches to see crime scenes? 
            Are they unemployed? Supported by a spouse or family or circumstance? Or can they do their work while investigating? Do they sell insurance
            door to door or sell weed to bartenders? This can inform your character choices, and you should feel encouraged to tell your GM your ideas so
            you can encounter elements of the mystery while juggling your work life.</p>
    <h3>Ticks and Traveling</h3>
        <p>Investigators must travel to and from locations, and this travel counts as a Scene which consumes Ticks. There is a calculation to determine 
            how many Ticks a traveling Scene consumes. First, start with a value based on the size of the area being traversed:</p>
        <div class="inset-box">
            <p><strong>Neighborhood</strong>: 1 Tick</p>
            <p><strong>Small Town</strong>: 2 Ticks (Twin Peaks, Washington)</p>
            <p><strong>City</strong>: 3 Ticks (Shreveport, Louisiana)</p>
            <p><strong>Metropolis</strong>: 4 Ticks (New York, New York)</p>
        </div>
        <p>If an actual map of the town or region where the adventure takes place is being used, divide the map into 9 squares on a grid. Add 2
            Ticks for each time the investigators must cross a grid line on the map to reach their destination. Do not cross diagonally: getting 
            to a grid space diagonally requires two crossings.</p>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="images/ticks-map.png" alt="Map of NYC with notable locations. The central 4 boroughs are divided into a nine-segment grid. 
            Staten Island is separated by an additional vertical black line.">
            <figcaption class="image-caption">The basic ticks map for our Eureka game... with one modification. The Ferry is a hassle!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Finally, subtract a number of Ticks based on the method of travel, seen below. The greater the subtraction, the better the mode of transport 
            is for getting around quickly. The final result is how many Ticks the traveling scene consumes.</p>
        <div class="inset-box">
            <p><strong>Feet</strong>: -2 Tick </p>
            <p><strong>Bad Public Transportation</strong>: -4 Ticks</p>
            <p><strong>Any Manually Powered Vehicle</strong>: -4 Ticks</p>
            <p><strong>Good Public Transportation</strong>: -6 Ticks</p>
            <p><strong>Any Regular Motor Vehicle</strong>: -6 Ticks</p>
            <p><strong>Motorcycle</strong>: -7 Ticks</p>
            <p><strong>Flying</strong>: -8 Ticks</p>
        </div>
        <p>An investigator may hurry, making a Skill check to attempt to remove Ticks off the time it takes them to reach their destination. </p>
        <p>For feet or a manually powered vehicle, use <strong>Athletics</strong>:</p>
        <div class="inset-box">
            <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: -2 Ticks from total travel time.</p>
            <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: -1 Tick from total travel time, -1 Composure (representing physical exhaustion).</p>
            <p><strong>Failure</strong>: -1 Composure.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For motor vehicles, use <strong>Driving</strong>:</p>
        <div class="inset-box">
            <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: -2 Ticks.</p>
            <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: -1 Tick.</p>
            <p><strong>Failure</strong>: <a href="index.html#vehicle-crash" class="keyword-link">Minor Crash</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>However, driving aggressively and recklessly like this always has the chance to attract police attention in any populated area. 
            Hurrying in a motor vehicle may result in a bystander alerting the police (see Heat).</p>

      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

    <h2>Character Creation Walkthrough</h2>
    <p>
        To create an investigator in Eureka, follow these simple steps. <a href="skillsntraits.html" class="keyword-link">Steps 2-3</a> 
        and <a href="inventory.html" class="keyword-link">Step 7</a> are more involved and have their own dedicated pages. Players are encouraged to 
        skim this page completely and then proceed in step order, navigating outside this page when prompted.
    </p>
    <p><em>Do not show your character sheet to anyone aside from the GM. </em>Eureka is a game of secrets. Often when investigating another
        player and their character will know things you won't.</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>: Come up with a concept. Characters in Eureka don't have classes. Instead, decide on a character concept that interests
        you. If you're having a hard time coming up with anything, think of famous investigators from popular media. Think about which of them would be 
        fun to play - are you a goofy pseudo-psychic detective or a stone-faced lead FBI investigator on the trail of a dangerous but entrancing killer? 
        If you're still having a hard time coming up with a concept, skip to the Traits list and see what inspires you.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        <a href="skillsntraits.html" class="keyword-link"><strong>Step 2-3</strong>:</a> Assign skills and traits. Skills are mostly the same for all 
        characters and represent your character's bonus or penalty to most rolls. You can give your investigator anywhere from +3 to -3 on any roll,
        but the sum of all skill modifiers must add to 0. Traits are most like Feats in D&D 5e and are special abilities that you can give your 
        character to get situational bonuses to rolls or other special opportunities. 
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>: Investigators with Disabilities (optional). It is already possible for investigators to become physically disabled as a result of
        wounds during their adventures, but players may also opt for their investigators to be disabled right from the start, either because they were in an accident, or because they
        were just born that way.
    </p>
    <p>Players may choose to start their investigator already having one or more Permanent <a href="index.html#grevious-wounds" class="keyword-link">Grievous Wounds</a> on
        their character sheet. This also means if they want to be functional, they will probably have to pay for a prosthetic or physical therapy when determining their starting
        inventory. There is no mechanical advantage associated with giving an investigator Grievous Wounds starting off. For more information about starting with a disability see 
        Eureka rulebook pg. 196.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>: Tiers of Fear. Players must fill in the Tiers of Fear on their investigator's character sheet with the fears below, sorting them into categories from “Ridiculous (+3)” to “Horrific
        (-3)” based on how scary or stressful the investigator would find those things. <em>At the bare minimum, the mandatory fears must be somewhere on every
        investigator's chart, because at least one of those things will likely appear in every Eureka adventure.</em> Optional fears do not need to be assigned, but it's usually helpful in the long run to
        consider as many as possible. Players may also come up with their own fears to put on their investigator's chart, if none of the optional fears fit the bill. For examples of different investigator archetypes
        and their Tiers of Fear see Eureka handbook page 201-202.

        <strong>Step 6</strong>: If characters in fiction always made the most logical decision in every situation, that wouldn't be very entertaining or even realistic. 
        Truth keeps the characters acting in-character. <em>It is encouraged, but not required, for an investigator to have a Truth when an
        adventure begins.</em>
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        An investigator's Truth represents a strong aspect of their beliefs and/or personality. It may be a virtue, it may be a flaw - whatever it is, it must be something that would
        spur them to action and/or get them into trouble. It could be their need to help others even at their own expense, their dog-eat-dog attitude, their belief in people's goodness
        above all else, their pride in their craft, their love of conflict, their insatiable curiosity, cowardice, excessive kindness, thrill-seeking, or anything else. An investigator is not
        limited to having one single Truth, so long as their Truths do not contradict each other - after all, people are more complex than a single sentence.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        By the same token, investigators need not always act within their Truth. Only the flattest characters display the more
        prominent aspects of their personality in literally every single situation. Similarly, while Truths cannot directly contradict
        each other, they can still be slightly paradoxical if it makes sense, such as “Only looks out for herself, unless her family is in danger.” 
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        <em>Once per Scene, when an investigator acts in a way that is congruent with their Truth, they are rewarded with a +1 Contextual modifier to their next five rolls.</em>
        These modifiers cease to apply immediately if the investigator's actions contradict their Truth. However, the Truth bonus is only granted when the investigator is not forced to take an action that is in line with their Truth - if there are no other options,
        they don't get the benefit. The official Eureka: Investigative Urban Fantasy character sheet has a checkbox beneath the “Truth” section for tracking
        whether an investigator has already benefited from their Truth in a Scene, and five more checkboxes for tracking how many Truth bonuses they have remaining in the current
        Scene.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 7</strong>: Inventory. Players can have On-Person, Secured, or Unsecured inventory. The <strong><a href="inventory.html" class="keyword-link">Inventory</a></strong>
        page will walk you through how to roll for your Wealth Points. These can be spent on items on the Item Lists. Items like vehicles and homes have <strong>Property Modifiers</strong>, 
        which can help your investigator acquire items they might have "lying around".

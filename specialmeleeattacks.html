     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025.

  <h2>Special Melee Attacks</h2>
  <p>
    All of the listed special attacks take an Action as normal, unless otherwise noted. Some special attacks take Weight Class into account, and may open the attacker up to a
    Counter-Attack.
  </p>
  <h3>Weight Class</h3>
  <p>
    Being outclassed in terms of weight, athleticism, or skill is extremely dangerous in melee combat. Certain special melee attacks will apply a Contextual bonus or a penalty to the
    attacker based on these differences between combatants, which we call the Weight Class modifier. <em>The Weight Class modifier is based on the numerical difference between the Athletics 
    bonus (including Traits) of the attacker and the target.</em>
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <h3>Counter-Attacks</h3>
  <p>
    Melee combat can be uniquely vulnerable compared to other means of dealing damage. Some special attacks listed below are risky maneuvers where the slightest mistake can
    leave the attacker vulnerable to being struck while they perform them. In these cases, the attacker is open to a Counter-Attack on certain results of the attack roll, which will
    be noted in the results table.
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <p>
    <em>If the attacker is open to a Counter-Attack, this allows their opponent to make a special retaliation against them during the original attacker's Turn.</em>
    A Counter-Attack does not take an Action, it is made strictly outside of the Turn order. A Counter-Attack can be a Basic Attack (either unarmed or with an equipped weapon) or
    any other special melee attack unless otherwise stated. This could even be an attack with a firearm, and just like with any other Basic
    Attack, that firearm could use its full Rate of Fire.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>If the attacker is incapacitated or killed by a Counter-Attack, the attack that triggered it does not occur.</em>
  </p>
  <h3>Knock-Out Blow</h3>
  <p>
    A Knock-Out Blow is a calculated, powerful strike with some part of the attacker's body. With a Knock-Out Blow, the attacker can deal more damage with an unarmed attack, at 
    the risk of leaving themselves open. A Knock-Out Blow cannot be made as a Counter Attack. <em>The attacker makes a Close Combat or Athletics roll with a -3 penalty, increasing to -5
    penalty if the target is wearing a helmet:</em>
  </p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The attack deals 4 Superficial Damage, ignoring all Armor.</p>
    <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The attack deals 2 Superficial Damage, ignoring all Armor.</p>
    <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The attack misses and leaves them vulnerable to a Counter-Attack.</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    A Knock-Out Blow cannot be used with most melee weapons. The ability of most melee weapons to deal serious harm without exposing the wielder is already factored
    into their normal damage. The one exception is brass knuckles. If using brass knuckles or a similar punch-augmenting weapon, a Knock-Out Blow can be made as normal,
    except a Partial Success also deals 4 Superficial Damage just like a Full Success.
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <h3>Disarm</h3>
  <p>
    A Disarm is an attempt to force a target to drop their weapon. A Disarm cannot be made as a Counter-Attack.
    The attacker makes a Close Combat roll with a -2 penalty, and also applies the Weight Class modifier:
  </p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The target is forced to drop their weapon.</p>
    <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The target is forced to drop their weapon, but they are allowed to make a Counter-Attack first.</p>
    <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The target is not forced to drop their weapon, and is also allowed to make a Counter-Attack.</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    If the weapon is dropped, the disarming character may choose to make a Reflexes roll. On a Full Success, they can grab and equip the weapon they just forced the target to
    drop.
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <h3>Shove</h3>
  <p>
    A Shove is an attack which attempts to move the target backwards. The attacker could stay where they are, or follow the target. Following the target (for instance, in a
    tackle or sustained shove) allows for a further push back. The attacker makes a Close Combat or Athletics roll, adding the Weight Class modifier:
  </p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: If the attacker follows, the target is pushed back up to the amount of space the attacker could cover with 1 Movement. If the attacker 
    does not follow, the target is pushed back up to one-third of that space (rounding down).</p>
    <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: If they have a weapon the target is allowed to make a Counter-Attack before being shoved. If the attacker follows, the target is pushed back
    up to half the amount of space the attacker could cover with 1 Movement. If the attacker does not follow, the target is pushed back up to one-third of that space (rounding down).</p>
    <p><strong>Failure</strong>: If they have a weapon the target is allowed to make a Counter-Attack. They are not pushed back.</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    If the target is pushed back by this, they must make a Reflexes roll. On a Failure, they are counted as falling 5 feet (taking 1 Superficial Damage) and are 
    <a href="index.html#ontheground" class="keyword-link">On the Ground.</a>
  </p>
  <h2>Grab</h2>
  <p>
    A Grab is any attempt to hold onto an opponent. Grappling is an extremely effective part of many real-world martial arts, and getting someone in a Grab is a prerequisite to
    Throw, Hold, and Compromise Armor attacks described below. <em>, Unlike most other melee attacks, Grabs do not require an Action (though they still do
    require a Movement). Furthermore, a Grab made as a Stealth Attack may immediately progress to a Hold at the attacker's option.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    The attacker makes a Close Combat or Athletics roll, adding the Weight Class modifier:
  </p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The target is Grabbed. </p>
    <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The target may make a Counter-Attack before being Grabbed. </p>
    <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The target may make a Counter-Attack and is not Grabbed.</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The target of a successful Grab is considered Grabbed. An attacker who has someone in a Grab necessarily has one or both of their hands occupied.
    None of the characters involved in a Grab can move away from each other, though the target may attempt to Escape. <em>A target who is Grabbed makes 
    all rolls with a -1 penalty for each character that is currently Grabbing them. Anyone outside the Grab who makes a melee attack
    against either character involved in the Grab does so with a +1 Contextual bonus.</em> Lastly, all Basic Attacks made between characters involved in the Grab apply the
    Weight Class Modifier, representing the control the participants have over each other's bodies, being able to push weapons away or force their opponent into vulnerable
    positions - or their lack of ability to resist the same.
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <h3>Throw</h3>
  <p>
    An attacker who has a character in a Grab may attempt to Throw them, which involves putting them off-balance and slamming them on the ground. A Throw may even be
    made as a Counter-Attack, as long as the target is Grabbing their attacker. The attacker makes a Close Combat roll:
  </p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: Any Grabs end for both characters and the target is slammed hard on the ground, taking 4 Superficial Damage, ignoring Armor. This is Penetrative
    Damage instead if the target is thrown onto an exceptionally hard surface, like concrete.</p>
    <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: Any Grabs end for both characters and the target is thrown with less force, taking 2 Superficial Damage, ignoring Armor. This is Penetrative Damage
    instead if the target is thrown onto a particularly hard surface, like concrete.</p>
    <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The throw attempt fails, putting the attacker off-balance. The target is still Grabbed, but may attempt a Counter-Attack.</p>
  </div>
  <p>If the target has a +2 or higher Skill rating in Close Combat, they take half damage from a Throw due to their training. A target who takes damage from a Throw is 
    <a href="index.html#ontheground" class="keyword-link">On the Ground.</a>.</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <h3>Holds & Submission</h3>
    <p>If a character is in a Grab, an attacker may attempt to put them in a Hold, even if they aren't the one Grabbing the target.
        The attacker makes a Close Combat roll, adding the Weight Class modifier:
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The Grab progresses to a Hold, and the target may be immediately put into Submission without taking an Action.</p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The Grab progresses to a Hold.</p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The Grab does not progress to a Hold. The target is still Grabbed, but may attempt a Counter-Attack</p>
    </div>
    <p>The target of a successful Hold is now considered Held instead of Grabbed. An attacker who has someone in a Hold necessarily has one or both of their hands
    occupied. <em>A character who is Held cannot move, but an attacker who is Holding a target may drag their target</em> - their Movements only traverse half the distance they normally
    would, and their target moves with them. <em>A target who is Held makes all rolls with a -3 penalty for each character that is
    currently Holding them.</em> Anyone outside the Hold who makes a melee attack against either character involved does so with a +2 Contextual bonus.</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>Finally, an attacker who is Holding a target may put them into Submission. Initiating or sustaining a Submission takes an Action, but does not call for a roll.
    <em>The target automatically takes 2 Superficial Damage whenever a Submission is initiated or sustained. Any Injury roll caused by Submission counts as one degree of success
    worse</em> - so a Full Success counts as a Partial Success, and a Partial Success counts as a Failure. A Failure is still a Failure.</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <h3>Compromise Armor</h3>
    <p>
        An attacker who has their target in a Grab may attempt to compromise their armor in some way. This might mean forcing open their helmet's visor, ripping open a 
        jacket, etc. This attack can only affect one piece of armor at a time. <em>Like Grabs, this attack does not require an Action (though it still does require a Movement).</em>
        The attacker makes a Close Combat Roll (if this attack is made to open or remove the visor of a Closed-face Helmet, add +1 to the roll):
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: One piece of the target's armor is compromised in some way. </p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: One piece of the target's armor is compromised in some way, but they may make a Counter-Attack. </p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The target's armor is not compromised, and they may make a Counter-Attack. </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Compromised armor may be ignored by attackers (dealing full damage) under certain circumstances. If it was completely removed, then the armor no longer applies at all
        until it is put on again. If compromised armor is still being at least partially worn, then this can only be taken advantage of and ignored by an attacker who has the target in a
        Grab or Hold. Whatever the outcome, follow the fiction. Examples of the outcomes of different attempts to Compromise Armor are in the Eureka rulebook on page 286.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <h3>Escape</h3>
    <p>
        If a character has been Grabbed or Held, they may attempt to break free. If an Escape is attempted, it must be the first Movement of the Turn.
        The character makes a Close Combat roll, applying the Weight Class modifier and any penalties from being Grabbed or Held:
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The character spends a Movement, and is no longer Grabbed or Held.</p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The character spends an Action, and is no longer Grabbed or Held.</p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The character is still Grabbed or Held, and their Turn immediately ends.</p>
    </div>

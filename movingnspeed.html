    <h1>Eureka Quick Reference</h1>
     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

     <h2>Moving and Positioning</h2>
 <p>While many of these sections are abridged versions of Eureka rulebook pages, this section is <em>specifically edited</em>
    to remove rules we will not be playing with. Specifically, characters in Eureka are not assumed to move at 5 feet per second 
    and rounds are not assumed to be six seconds long. Finally, all of Eureka's combat will occur in Theater of the Mind.</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
 <h3>Distance and Nodes</h3>
 <p>
    In high-pressure situations, distance will be expressed in nodes. A “node” is basically just a way of marking an area in the space of the game world that can be
    connected to any number of other areas. When characters are at the same node, they are generally considered to be able to make melee attacks against each other or otherwise
    directly interact. When using nodes, one Movement can traverse 1 node. A character can move to any adjacent node, as long as nothing is stopping them from doing so.
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <p>
    Nodes are of an indefinite, irregular size and distance from each other. They're not supposed to line up with any uniform real-world measurements, it's just a fast and
    easy-to-use approximation of character position. In a bar room brawl, there may be one node for each section of the bar counter, one at the entrance, one or two around the
    seating area, and one or two around the pool table. In a high speed car chase there may be one or two nodes per city block. 
 </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <p>
    Since nodes don't correspond to any real-world distances, determining how far away a gun can shoot or a grenade explosion reaches can be tricky. In small settings, 
    a range of 30 yards might span 15 nodes. In motorized vehicle chases, it might be 1 node - with your opponents 2 nodes away. Your GM will work with you to determine fair 
    ranges when the first gun is brandished.
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
 <h3>Speed</h3>
 <p>
    Oftentimes, characters will want to traverse more space than two Movements per Round would allow. When this happens, they will need to roll Speed to see how fast they
    can move relative to other characters. Like Ticks, the Speed stat is ultimately an abstraction - it doesn't directly correlate to any real-world velocity. <em>The purpose of
    Speed is mostly to determine how fast characters are relative to each other</em>.
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <p>
    Calculating Speed changes the number of Movements that a character can take on their Turn. <em>Instead of two Movements per Turn, a character can take a number of
    Movements equal to their Speed, but still only one of those Movements may be an Action, as normal.</em>
    In general, Speed is calculated only once for each character for the duration of an entire Scene, not Round-by-Round. There may be circumstances where Speed ought to
    change dramatically (such as an on-foot character getting into a car). In that case, it is appropriate to recalculate Speed.
 </p>
   <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        Movement in Eureka cannot be interrupted. This means that if you move to one node to interact with something, like skimming a document, making a melee attack,
        or picking up a baseball bat, <em>your movement is over, even if your speed has been increased by a speed roll</em>. A character's Speed only needs to be calculated for 
        a given Scene the first time that character tries to move more than the minimum distance they could cover with two Movements. This will mean that some (even most) instances of combat will start and
        end without anyone ever needing to calculate Speed in the first place. 
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <p>To calculate Speed:</p>
 <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>1.</strong> Roll 1D6+[Skill]+[Acceleration], with a minimum of 1</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> Divide the result by 2 (rounding up).</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> Add +1</p>
 </div>
 <p>The result is the character's Speed. If a character is on-foot or using a manually-powered vehicle such as a skateboard or bicycle, use Athletics as the Skill. If
    they're using a motor vehicle, use Driving (or another relevant Skill, like Boating).</p>

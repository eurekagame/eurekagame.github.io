    <h1>Eureka Quick Reference</h1>
     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

  <h2>Firearms</h2>
  <p>
    Though extremely effective, guns require a number of considerations that other kinds of weapons don't. The specific rules for making an attack with a firearm are in Chapter
    Three, but properties of specific firearms (such as their range, possible rates of fire, and other relevant special properties) are listed here for convenience.
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
    <h3>Effective Range</h3>
      <p>
        Each type of firearm has an effective range. Firing at targets within the gun's effective range does not incur any penalty. <em>Targets which are further away than the effective
        range incur a -1 penalty for each increment of the effective range beyond the first.</em> If the target is within one fifth of a gun's effective range, there is a +2 Contextual
        bonus. Long guns get this bonus as usual, but if the target is within arm's reach, they receive a -2 penalty instead.
      </p>
      <p>Here's an example of the range for a single-action revolver:</p>
      <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Arm's Reach</strong>: +2</p>
        <p><strong>2-6 yards</strong>: +2</p>
        <p><strong>7-30 yards</strong>: 0</p>
        <p><strong>31-60 yards</strong>: -1</p>
        <p><strong>61-90 yards</strong>: -2</p>
        <p><strong>91-120 yards</strong>: -3</p>
      </div>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
    <h3>Magazines</h3>
      <p>
        Guns have either internal or external magazines, which can hold a certain number of cartridges. Guns with external magazines can hold one bullet over their normal capacity
        by loading a full magazine while a bullet is already in the chamber. The magazine type and its capacity will be noted in the gun information list, below.
        If a gun has external magazines, these magazines and the bullets within should be kept track of individually in the character's inventory.
        The official Eureka character sheet has a place on the inventory page specifically for tracking magazines.
      </p>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
    <h3>Reloading</h3>
      <p>
        Reloading in a tense situation is stressful and often time consuming. Be aware that in the kind of shootouts that tend to happen in Eureka, if a character needs to 
        reload at all they are probably in over their head. Quickly reloading either type of magazine requires a roll,
        as detailed below. <em>This roll is made with a -2 penalty if attempted one-handed</em>. Details about the action economy of Eureka combat is on the 
        <a href="turnsnrounds.html" class="keyword-link">Turns and Combat</a> page.
      </p>
      <p><strong>External Magazines</strong>: The amount of time it takes to load a gun with external magazines is determined by a Firearms roll:</p>
      <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: It takes 1 Movement.
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: It takes 1 Action.
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: It takes 2 Actions.
      </div>
      <p>
        <strong>Internal Magazines</strong>: Reloading revolvers and other single-load guns always takes 1 Action, during which the character can load 
        (1D6 + their Firearms bonus) bullets into the magazine. Also use this rule if loading loose bullets into an empty external
        magazine. If using a speed-loader or stripper clip, then use the external magazine rule instead.
      </p>
      <h3>Rate of Fire</h3>
      <p>Different guns can fire more or less bullets in the same span of time. A given gun could be capable of multiple rates of fire. This is not necessarily reflective of a weapon's
      settings, simply how fast it can physically be fired with any degree of reliability. </p>
      <p>A gun can fire a number of bullets equal to its RoF in a single Action. <em>Guns can only fire at their listed RoF(s) -
        no higher or lower.</em> This will be represented numerically - so ‚Äú1‚Äù means the gun can fire a single bullet during an Action, ‚Äú3‚Äù means it can fire three bullets, and ‚Äú1-15‚Äù means it
        can fire anywhere from 1 to 15 bullets as the user desires.</p>
      <p>
        Some long repeating guns require two hands on the gun to cycle quickly. If a character only has one hand free, cycling the gun requires an Action. If their Firearms bonus
        (including Traits) is +3 or higher, it requires a Movement instead.
      </p>
      <h4>Automatic Fire</h4>
      <p>Below a certain level of training, automatic fire is very difficult to control. <em>If a character is firing a gun which is either set to ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù or has no other setting, they must
        roll 1D12+3 to determine their Rate of Fire for each Action.</em> If they have a total Firearms modifier of +1 or higher, they may skip this roll and choose their RoF as
        normal.
      </p>
      <h4>Quick Cycling</h4>
      <p>
        Characters with a +2 or higher Skill rating in Firearms may increase the RoF of any semi-automatic, single-action, or repeating gun by +1. This only applies when it
        makes sense - they might be able to fire four bullets during an Action with a semi-automatic rifle, but they can't force a ‚Äúthree-round burst‚Äù setting to fire four
        bullets.
      </p>
      <h3>Firearm Categories</h3>
      <p>
        Eureka sorts firearms into categories that cover the broad attributes of different kinds of guns. Most real-world firearms should fit into one category on this list. Each category
        will list an example of a real-world firearm that fits the category, and then notes several statistics, as described above. If a player wants to use a specific real-world gun with 
        differences, likely in magazine capacity, from their category dictates, they can work with the GM to determine appropriate statistics for the gun.

      <h3>Special Properties</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the firearms listed above are labeled with SP, which stands for Special Properties. There are two kinds of special properties:
        Stopping Power and Shotgun
      </p>
      <h4>Stopping Power</h4>
      <p>
        Bigger, faster bullets cause bigger, more debilitating wounds in the body. Any bullet higher-calibre than a handgun has stopping power. 
        <em>‚ÄúStopping power‚Äù means that any Injury roll caused by that bullet will count as one degree of success worse</em> - so a Full Success counts as a Partial Success, and a Partial Success
        counts as a Failure. A Failure is still a Failure.
      </p>
      <h4>Shotguns</h4>
      <p>
        Shotguns work differently from other firearms. A shotgun may be loaded with slugs or shot. Firing slugs works exactly the same as firing ordinary bullets. The gun uses its
        listed effective range, and the slug has stopping power like any other high-calibre bullet.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúShot‚Äù is a bunch of small lead pellets packed into a shell instead of a single bullet. Firing shot instead of slugs or bullets differs in two important ways: First, all shot has a
        45 yard effective range increment. Secondly, stopping power (and sometimes damage) from shot works differently from other bullets, since it is coming from the sheer volume
        of projectiles hitting the body, instead of velocity. Refer to the chart below for the effects.
      </p>
      <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>0-4 yards</strong>: Shotgun pellets need time and space to spread out for maximum effectiveness. Within this range, shotgun pellets have standard stopping power, just like
        a high-calibre bullet.</p>
        <p><strong>5-10 yards</strong>: Within this range, shotgun pellets have double stopping power - the Injury roll counts as two degrees worse, so even a Full Success counts as a Failure. This
        means no matter how tough a character is, a shotgun blast at 5-10 yards would still instantly inflict Incapacitation every time, no matter the roll. Don't get hit.</p>
        <p><strong>11-20 yards</strong>: Within this range, shotgun pellets have standard stopping power, just like a high-calibre bullet.</p>
        <p><strong>21-45 yards</strong>: Within this range, shotgun pellets do not have stopping power, like a low-calibre bullet.</p>
        <p><strong>46+ yards</strong>: Beyond 45 yards, shotgun pellets do 2 Penetrative damage instead of 4 Penetrative damage, and do not have stopping power. They also take effective range
        penalties, as usual.</p>

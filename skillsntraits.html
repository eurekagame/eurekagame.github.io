    <h1>Eureka Quick Reference</h1>
     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

 <section class="main-section">
    <p>Eureka has no character classes. Instead, players build their investigators by setting bonuses to
        some of the following skills and by choosing specific situational bonuses called traits. If you're
        having trouble building a character, try thinking of archtypical detectives you enjoy from fictional 
        media. The list of Traits includes many meant to evoke these archetypes. Tell your Narrator your 
        concert as soon as possible for a story experience more tailored to your character! <em>Players should 
        not show their character sheets to anyone except the Narrator unless absolutely necessary</em>. 
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
 <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
        Skills are the main way in which Eureka characters interact with the world. All investigators 
        have the same set of Core Skills, as seen on their character sheet. Every Core Skill can have a 
        rating[1] between -3 and +3. This rating provides the modifier on any roll with that Skill.
        <em>The only rule of Skill allocation is that the cumulative rating of all of an investigator's Skills 
            should add up to 0.</em>
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        A 0 usually (but not always) represents average competency, a -3 complete incompetence, and a +3 an 
        exceptional level of experience and/or training. A +4 represents absolute mastery of a subject, 
        such as olympic-level ability. A character is likely to only have a +3 in a skill if they have a 
        lot of specialized education or a decade of experience.

        <h2>Interpersonal Skills</h2>
        <p>Interpersonal Skills measure an investigator's ability to interact socially with other characters 
        to a desired effect. Interpersonal Skills, much like actual interpersonal interactions, can be 
        ambiguous in their application. What if a line of dialogue is particularly fumbling or effective? 
        Was that a threat or an argument?</p>
    <p>To prevent this, try to, before rolling, describe your goal in the social interaction and what 
        you think the best strategy to convince the other character is. Then roll the relevant skill.
        After seeing the results of the roll, you can state your in-character dialogue. Interpersonal 
        roll should only be called for when there is some risk, or the outcome is in question.</p>

        <div class="skill-details">
          <p>
                Charm is a general measure of how charismatic and personable a character is. Use 
                this Skill when earning the trust or affection of others, vouching for oneself against 
                an accusation, or when a character needs to open doors with a winning smile.

        <div class="skill-details">
            <p>
              Comfort is a measure of how good a character is at de-escalating tense situations and
              soothing frayed nerves. Use this Skill when calming an agitated person, talking down a 
              crazed gunman, or attempting to restore another investigator's <strong>Composure</strong>.
              The difference between Comfort and Charm is usually that Comfort is used when attempting to 
              earn people's trust in intense, dangerous situations while Charm is used to earn people's 
              trust in a more relaxed environment.

        <div class="skill-details">
            <p>
              Manipulate is a measure of how good a character is at using deception to get 
              a desired result. Use this Skill when tricking someone into going against their
              own best interest, running a con on someone, or just plain lying. Clever investigators 
              do not necessarily need to stray from the truth to mislead someone. In some rare
              cases, this Skill can also be used when the investigator is actually telling the truth, but
              that truth is just exceptionally hard to believe.

            <p>
              Seduce does not necessarily represent a character's physical attractiveness 
              (although that can be a factor), but it is a measure of their ability to make 
              themselves attractive, whether through words, attire, physical features, or anything 
              else of the sort. Use this Skill when flirting incriminating information out of a suspect, 
              distracting a lonely guard, or getting the target alone in a locked bedroom. In the right 
              place, with the right person, a good Seduce roll can be much, much more effective
              than a good Charm roll, though it may not be effective at all if the target does not swing that way.

        </button>
        <div class="skill-details">
            <p>
              Social Cues is a measure of how good a character is at reading social situations,
              but not necessarily acting in them. Use this Skill when reading facial expressions, 
              determining if someone is lying, or trying to “read the room.” It will tell an investigator 
              how others around them seem to be feeling, and may provide a hint as to what their intentions 
              might be or what kind of words might swing their mood in one's favor.

        </button>
        <div class="skill-details">
            <p>
              Like Seduce, Threaten does not necessarily represent a character's physically imposing 
              form (although that can be a major factor), but it is a measure of their ability to make
              themselves threatening by their words or appearance. Use this Skill when telling someone
              what could happen to him or his loved ones if he doesn't unlock the door, or convincing 
              some punk that he better go pick a fight with absolutely anybody else. Sufficiently threatening 
              actions for some situations will not require a check - pointing a gun at an unarmed civilian usually doesn't 
              have a significant risk of failure.

      <h2>Knowledge Skills</h2>
      <p>
          Knowledge Skills are measures of an investigator's, well, knowledge (or ability to quickly
          find out information on the subject). As a reminder, there is no magical video
          game sense in Eureka that automatically highlights all the clues in a room as soon as the
          investigators walk in. By the same token, investigators do not need rolls to see what is in
          front of them. Investigative Rolls are not made to find points of interest, they are used to
          glean information from points of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
         A lower degree of success (rather than a consequence) is usually the way to handle
         Partial Successes on Knowledge rolls. However, sometimes a consequence is appropriate, and usually it will fall into one of two categories. Either examining a point
         of interest takes a long time (which would consume a Tick), or the investigator leaves evidence that they have tampered with something.

        <div class="skill-details">
          <p>
                Chemistry represents a character's knowledge of chemistry and closely related fields. Use this Skill when
                determining how long a rusty blade may have been sitting in a
                creek, predicting what might result from the mixing of multiple chemicals, or producing a desired chemical reaction.

                Medicine is a measure of a character's general medical knowledge. Use 
                this Skill when determining the cause of wounds on a body, identifying symptoms 
                of an illness, or just recognizing complex medical jargon. (This Skill is also used to treat wounds).

              Nature is a measure of a character's knowledge of the natural
              world, survival skills, and basically anything else you're supposed to learn in Boy Scouts. Use this Skill when identifying local fauna from
              their tracks, determining what mushrooms are safe to eat, or avoiding frostbite during a cold winter night lost in the mountains.

          <p>
              Paperwork is a measure of a character's ability to quickly parse most types of written
              information. A high Paperwork rating indicates the ability to read quickly and pick out the
              most important bits of information from the text. Use this Skill when gleaning information from the papers on the police chief's desk at a
              glance, reading more difficult forms of writing such as shorthand or flowery cursive, searching the library's messy card catalog, or to recognize when the numbers in the
              account book just don't add up. Paperwork is only needed to either read
              quickly or successfully pick out important information from junk data. If the investigators find a single page of information, there is no need for a roll.

              identifying what these occult symbols might mean and what they might be intended to do, remembering as many obscure vampire weaknesses as possible, or

              an incident they can look into. Those leads may or may not then have the “right” answer.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              This Skill, pronounced as the “Blacked Out Skill” or “Redacted Skill,” is marked out on the character sheet like one would mark
              out a classified document. If you don't know what this Skill is, you're not supposed to! This Skill and its uses are a mystery to new players. All you need to know is that it is a
              real Skill that may be called for during an adventure. It is up to you if your investigator would have points in it or wrench it dry for Skill ratings. The type of person who would
              invest into an unknown, mysterious Skill is just the type of person who would have high marks in this.

      <h2>Physical Skills</h2>
      <p>
          Physical Skills are a measure of an investigator's ability to do things, y'know, physically. Physical Skills are used frequently in combat.
          Many Physical Skills can also be used as Knowledge Skills, and whenever possible this will be noted in the Skill description. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
        Physical Skills cover a wide range of actions, and are the most likely Skills to be used for Non-Investigative Rolls. Sometimes, such as in combat or in chases, the results of
        Partial Success or Failure are very specific, and will be outlined in the appropriate section. For scenarios where the result is not obvious or
        strictly defined, here are some possibilities:</ul>
          <li>The investigator succeeds, but takes much longer than they'd like to do so. (This would consume 1 Tick).</li>
          <li>The investigator over-exerts themself and takes 1 Superficial Damage, either from bodily pain or from scraping on something hard or sharp in the environment.</li>
          <li>The investigator succeeds, but leaves evidence - immediate or lasting - of their involvement. For example, making a bunch of noise that calls the attention of the
              security guard, or breaking something that leaves evidence of tampering and cannot be easily cleaned up by the investigator.</li>

          <p>
              Athletics is a measure of a character's general physical fitness and, well, athleticism. Use
              this Skill when a character is running, climbing, swimming, lifting heavy objects, or anything else which requires a high degree of
              strength and/or stamina. This skill is also used for the more basic moves in melee combat, such as punching and kicking, and determines how well a character handles
              bodily harm. The Athletics Skill can also be used as a Knowledge Skill, such as to tell at a glance how easy something might be to lift or tell how strong somebody is just by
              looking at them. Additionally, Manually powered vehicles are operated using the Athletics Skill. Using any land vehicle in an off-road environment confers a -3 penalty.

              Close Combat is a measure of a character's Skill with the martial arts, and is used for
              most advanced moves in melee combat as well as using close-combat weapons. This Skill can also be used like
              a Knowledge Skill, such as to identify the place of origin of an attacker's technique, to notice that the
              suspect stands like a fighter, or to identify what level of practice a person's belt color denotes.

              motor vehicles that behave significantly differently from cars, see “Optional/Write-in Skills” below.) This Skill may also be
              used as a Knowledge Skill, such as pointing out makes and models of cars at a glance, identifying tire tracks, or diagnosing
              a problem based on engine noises.

              penetrating the human body. This Skill can also be used like a Knowledge Skill, such as to identify what kind of gun might
              have fired spent brass casings, knowing what firearms and accessories are and aren't legal to own in a particular state, and how far away gunshots
              probably were.

              quickly without time to think, such as drawing as soon as a gangster reaches for his gun, gaining the initiative in a fist fight, diving out of
              the way of an oncoming car, or even just catching a small object without looking like an idiot.

              Senses is a measure of a character's alertness and the acuteness of their five senses. Use this Skill when detecting lurking danger, such as spotting a man in
              camouflage, or smelling natural gas from a leak inside a house. In some cases, the Narrator may want to note the Senses score of
              each investigator and make secret Senses rolls for them, so that the players don't know anything their investigators don't know. Remember, clues and locations 
              will be verbally described - a Senses roll is not a replacement for investigation! <em>
              The Senses Skill takes relevant penalties when there is interference in the environment - investigators trying to hide might give their opponents contextual modifiers by hiding

    <div class="category-description">
      <h2>Wealth</h2>
      <p>
          Wealth is a unique Skill which does not fit into any of the other three categories, has some unusual applications, and has ramifications on character creation for determining
          what items an investigator has access to. The Wealth skill is the only Skill that is not affected by <strong>Composure</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>Wealth is a measure of a character's wealth and means. It does not count as an Interpersonal, Knowledge, or Physical skill. Use this Skill when buying things, bribing a
        security guard or cop to look the other way, or helping an informant jog his memory. Wealth can also be used as a Knowledge Skill for things such as knowing where the
        classiest restaurants in town are, recognizing an expensive designer brand, or generally knowing the ins and outs of celebrity and an upper class lifestyle. </p>
      <p>
        Unlike with any other Skill, Wealth may be used in reverse (a +1 becomes a -1, a -2 becomes a +2, etc.) to roll for knowledge
        that a character might obtain from living in poverty, such as where the best places to get the cheapest meals are, what streets are safest to walk down at night, who frequents the
        local homeless shelters and soup kitchens, etc
      </p>
      <p><em>Within reason</em>, the Wealth Skill can also be rolled to purchase useful items. When rolling the Wealth Skill in this way, subtract half the Wealth
        Point cost (rounding down, to a minimum of 0) of the desired item from the roll. The results of this are as follows:</p>
        <div class="inset-box2">
          <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: They can afford it no problem.</p>
          <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: They are able to buy the item, but with a consequence. Here are some suggestions:</p>
              <ul class="list">
                  <li>They may be able to just barely afford it, but going through with the purchase might mean financial hardship, leading to an immediate Poverty <strong>Composure</strong> Roll.</li>
                  <li>They can only find or afford the cheaper, crappier version of the desired item. If the Narrator has no
                    particular plan or idea for how a “cheap and crappy” item is prone to failure, they can simply roll a D6 every time the item is used. On a 6, it breaks. </li>
                  <li>The item will take an inconveniently long time to be created or delivered when time is of the essence.</li>
                </ul>
          <p><strong>Failure</strong>: They can't afford it, or at least aren't liquid enough right now to do so. Maybe their card is declined, or maybe their bank flagged a suspicious purchase and
            froze the card. They must also immediately make a Poverty <strong>Composure</strong> Roll.</p>
        </div>
      <p><em>Within reason</em>, Wealth may also be used to check if an investigator already has a particular useful item in a <strong>Secured inventory</strong> space such as in a vehicle or home.
       When rolling Wealth in this way, subtract half the Wealth Point cost (rounding down, to a minimum of 0), then apply the Property modifier
       of the home or vehicle. These useful items don't magically appear. In the narrative of the game, they were bought beforehand and the investigator
       is just remembering that they have them. Investigators will have to physically return to their vehicle or home to retrieve these items.
      </p>
       <div class="inset-box2">
          <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: Add the item to the investigators Secured Inventory.</p>
          <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: Add the item to the investigators Secured Inventory, but like with purchasing items, there will be some drawback. </p>
          <p><strong>Failure</strong>: Do not add the item to the investigators Secured Inventory. Maybe they couldn't afford it, lost it, or had to sell it to make rent some time before the adventure
            started. Unlike when purchasing items directly, they do not have to make a Poverty <strong>Composure</strong> Roll.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      </div>
  </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Write In Skills</h2>
  <p>On an investigator's character sheet, there are blank spaces that may optionally be filled in with Write-in Skills. These Skills represent more specific fields of knowledge that
    are not covered by the general Skill list. There are 14 official Write-in skills: Ancient Language (Knowledge), Boating (Physical), Cooking (Knowledge), Forgery (Knowledge),
    Heavy Machinery (Physical), History (Knowledge), Language (Knowledge), Law (Knowledge), Lock Picking (Physical), Pickpocketing (Physical), Piloting, Airplane (Physical), 
    Piloting, Helicopter (Physical), Religion (Knowledge), and Riding (Physical). For a full description of all write-in skills, browse the attached pdf or pages 166-174 on the 
    full Eureka Rulebook
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <p>
    At the Narrator's discretion, a player may make a new Write-in Skill if they know their character should be skilled at something that is not represented by anything
    else in the rulebook. An investigator may have any number of Write-in Skills, but a Write-in skill must have a rating of at least +1 and this counts towards the total of an investigator's Skill
    ratings, which must always be zero. <em>Any character can try to use a Write-in Skill listed below that they do not have (or any
    specific skillset that does not fit well under any existing Skill). If they do, instead use whatever Skill on their sheet seems to fit best, but with a -3 penalty</em>.

  <h2>Traits</h2>
  <p>
    Investigators can be all kinds of different people from any imaginable walk of life. Instead of trying to squeeze a character concept into or out of a “class” or 
    “playbook,” Eureka opts for a much more modular system. With Traits, the unique personality of the investigator
    becomes the way they are played (narratively and mechanically). Investigators must have at least three Traits, but may have up to six. <em>However, each additional
    Trait past the third will increase the number of Investigation Points they need to get a Eureka! by 3.</em>
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <p>
    A Skill roll can be modified by multiple Traits at once and this is not a conflict, even if one is a bonus and the other is a penalty. However, an investigator's Base modifier in a
    Skill should never be +5 or higher after applying non-supernatural Traits, as this represents a superhuman level of ability. This won't come up often, but if an
    investigator has two of these Traits which grant a +1 Base modifier to the same Skill, they should have a maximum rating of +2 in that Skill instead of +3.
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <p>
    There are dozens of unique traits with different benefits and penalties for your investigator. For ease of navigation, the full list of traits is attached as a pdf below.
    Your GM may choose to add all traits chosen by player characters to the Compendium for ease of navigation, at which point this section will be updated to provide those links.

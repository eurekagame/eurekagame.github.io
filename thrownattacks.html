    <h1>Eureka Quick Reference</h1>
     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025.
      </p>

 <h2>Throwing Objects</h2>
 <p>
    Throwing objects at a target works exactly like any other Basic Attack. Use Athletics for the roll if it doesn't matter how the object hits a target (e.g. a rock), or use Close
    Combat if it does (e.g. a throwing knife). Thrown objects have the same damage values they would have if they were swung as melee weapons.
    <em>When throwing objects, apply a -1 accuracy penalty for every 30 feet of distance away the target is.</em> 
 </p>
 <p>
    An object can only be thrown up to a certain maximum distance, depending on the total Athletics modifier of the attacker. Page 287 includes a table
    for both light and heavy objects that determines maximum throwing distance by Athletics modifier.
 </p>
 <p>
    Certain factors apply a flat penalty to attacks with thrown weapons:
 </p>
 <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>Throwing while using 2 or more Movements to travel</strong>: -1 Penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>Target is fast-moving (e.g. using 2 or more Movements to travel)</strong>: -1 penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>Target is particularly fast (e.g. bird in flight)</strong>: -2 penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>Throwing with the off-hand</strong>: Additional -2 penalty.</p>
 </div>
 <h3>Throwing Explosives</h3>
 <p>
    Explosive weapons target locations rather than characters, and any characters caught within the blast radius will be affected. Throwing or launching an explosive requires a
    relevant Skill roll, generally Athletics or Firearms. Explosives are volatile and imprecise, even a perfect throw or shot will affect the
    environment in unpredictable ways. There will always be a Woo Roll when using explosive weapons.
 </p>
 <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The explosive lands exactly on the target location. Make a Woo Roll with a +0 modifier.</p>
    <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The explosive lands off-target (see below). Make a Woo Roll with a -1 modifier.</p>
    <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The explosive lands even more off-target (see below). Make a Woo Roll with a -2 modifier.</p>
 </div>
 <h3>Landing Off-Target</h3>
 <p>
    Unlike a regular thrown weapon, if an explosive doesn't hit its exact target, it really matters where it ends up. To make matters worse, handheld explosives can bounce, roll,
    and are sometimes irregularly shaped, which can make it difficult to land them exactly where you want them. To this end, Eureka tracks exactly where explosives land
    off-target. 
 </p>
 <p>
    When using theater of the mind, roll on this table to see where the explosive lands. Roll 1D6 if the attack roll was a Partial Success, or roll 2D6 if it was a Failure:
 </p>
 <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>1</strong>: Lands on its intended target.</p>
    <p><strong>2</strong>: Goes wide to the attacker's right, but the target is still within the radius.</p>
    <p><strong>3</strong>: Goes wide to the attacker's left, but the target is still within the radius.</p>
    <p><strong>4</strong>: Bounces or rolls further than intended, but the target is still within the radius.</p>
    <p><strong>5</strong>: The throw is shorter than intended, but the target is still within the radius.</p>
    <p><strong>6</strong>: Explodes between attacker and target, hitting neither if possible, otherwise make an additional Woo Roll.</p>
    <p><strong>7</strong>: Goes wide to the attacker's right, and the target is outside the radius.</p>
    <p><strong>8</strong>: Goes wide to the attacker's left, and the target is outside the radius.</p>
    <p><strong>9</strong>: Bounces or rolls further than intended, and the target is outside the radius.</p>
    <p><strong>10</strong>: The throw is shorter than intended, and the target is outside the radius</p>
    <p><strong>11</strong>: Explodes within range of both attacker and target if possible, otherwise make an additional Woo Roll.</p>
    <p><strong>12</strong>: Bounces back towards the attacker; the attacker is within the radius, and the original target is outside the radius if possible. If the target cannot be outside the
    radius, make an additional Woo Roll.</p>
 </div>
 <h3>Responses to Explosives</h3>
 <p>
    When an explosive lands near a character, they typically have a second or two to react before it goes off. Characters can
    <a href="index.html#ducking" class="keyword-link">Duck</a> in response to being in the blast radius of an explosive, just like they can react
    to being shot at. This is not a Movement, and occurs outside the Turn order. Instead of imposing a penalty to the attack roll, a character who is Ducking
    takes half damage from the explosive. Additionally, if a character is within the blast radius of an explosive, but there is <a href="index.html#cover" 
    class="keyword-link">Cover</a> between them and the explosive, they take half damage.
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <p>
    A character may instead make a Reflexes roll to attempt to act quickly, possibly getting more done than just Ducking, but this is risky. If they have already taken their
    Turn this Round, they make this roll with a -2 penalty:
 </p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The character may Duck if they so choose, and gets to take their Turn early (or, if they have already taken it, an extra Turn out of Turn order). This entire
    Turn occurs before the explosive detonates.</p>
    <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The character may Duck if they so choose, and the character gets to take a single Movement (which cannot be an Action) outside of Turn order. This
    occurs before the explosive detonates.</p>
    <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The character cannot act in any way or Duck before the explosive detonates.</p>

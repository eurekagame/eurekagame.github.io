      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

    <div class="compendium-term" id="cover">
      <h3>Cover</h3>
      <p>Characters which are behind cover are harder to shoot. Being “in cover” isn't a property a character has, it is a relationship they have to a source of damage. As long as they are
      reasonably close to the source of cover, and the cover is between them and the source of damage, they receive the benefits. This works vertically too, meaning
      shooters in elevated positions are hard to hide from. Additionally, simply being in a sufficiently high position may give characters cover, because whatever they are standing
      on obscures part of their body from anyone down below. Of course, because cover has to be between the shooter and the target, a shooter can move position to get a clear angle and
      negate the benefits of cover - but watch out, trying to do so might provoke a Reaction.</p>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
      <p>There are two types of cover: <strong>Soft Cover</strong> and <strong>Hard Cover</strong>. The benefits from both types stack with each other, but only one source of each type can apply at a time. Both types
      of cover provide some protection against Firearms attacks, but Hard Cover additionally reduces damage from explosives by half.</p>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
      <p><em>Shooting at a target hidden by Soft Cover imposes a -1 penalty to the Firearms roll to hit.</em> Soft Cover is any kind of cover which bullets can easily penetrate, but still at least
      partially obscures or conceals the character. Examples include most interior walls of buildings, cars (regular cars are not bulletproof), trees, foliage, etc.</p>
      <p><em>Shooting at a target hidden by Hard Cover imposes a -2 penalty to the Firearms roll to hit.</em>Hard Cover is any kind of cover which bullets can not easily penetrate, and which
      at least partially obscures the character. Examples include brick, stone, concrete, sandbags, earth trenches, solid metal barricades, etc.</p>

    <div class="compendium-term" id="ducking">
      <h3>Ducking</h3>
      <p>Characters can drop to the floor or dive to the ground at any time, and this does not take a Movement. We call this “Ducking.” Characters can Duck in response to danger, such
      as when they are aware they are about to be shot at or an explosive lands nearby, <em>even if it is not their Turn</em>. Doing so puts them <a href="index.html#ontheground"
      class="keyword-link"> On the Ground</a> </p>
      <p>This doesn't always literally mean laying flat on the ground - it could be any action that involves a sudden and total change in position to avoid danger, such as literally ducking
      behind a low wall, diving flat on the ground, leaping out of the way, whatever the situation calls for. Regardless, it mechanically counts as being On the Ground, and thus
      requires a Reflexes roll to “stand up.”</p>

    <div class="compendium-term" id="modifiers">
     <h3>Modifiers</h3>
     <p>Modifiers are a number added to every dice roll to get the end result. Every roll in Eureka
      has a modifier, even if it is +0. For negative modifiers, subtract that number from the
      dice roll, and for positive modifiers, add that number. In almost every case, a modifier
      comes from something on the character sheet, such as a Skill or Trait. Positive
      modifiers (or “bonuses”) mean the character is better at those things, and more likely to
      succeed. Negative modifiers (or “penalties”) mean the character is worse at those things, and more likely to
      fail.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="compendium-term" id="ontheground">
     <h3>On the Ground</h3>
     <p>
      Plenty of situations could lead to a character being prone or supine on the ground, which applies some restrictions. If a character is On the Ground, their Movements
      only traverse half the distance they normally would, and they make melee attacks at a -2 penalty (if using Athletics), or at a -1 penalty (if using Close Combat).
      Additionally, ranged attacks made against them from further than 20 yards away are made with a -2 penalty, and melee attacks targeting them are made with +2
      Contextual bonus.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>The benefits of being on the ground and cover can stack.</strong> If a character
      is On the Ground and behind Cover (of any kind), then all ranged attacks made against them take the -2 penalty, even from closer than 20 yards away. A character who is On
      the Ground and behind Cover they can't see past can still fire blindly over or around it, but all of these shots take a -4 penalty.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a character is On the Ground, they may get up on their Turn. A Reflexes roll is made to see how long this takes:
     </p>
     <div class="inset-box">
      <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: Standing up takes a Movement.</p>
      <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: Standing up takes an Action.</p>
      <p><strong>Failure</strong>: Standing up takes their entire Turn, and they are not able to make any further Movements.</p>
     </div>
     <p>
      Being On the Ground does not prevent characters from attempting Reactions, but might
      cause their extra Turn to be underwhelming if they spend the whole time standing up.
     </p>
     <a href="#rules-compendium" class="back-link">↑ Back to top</a>
    </div>

    <div class="compendium-term" id="special-armor">
     <h3>Special Armor</h3>
     <p>There are benefits to having more armor coverage, and there are some things that certain armors protect against that others will not.</p>
     <p><strong>Bulletproof Armor</strong>: Military Helmets, Kevlar Vests, and Plate Carriers also protect against bullets in addition to other sources of damage. Military Helmets are also usually
      Open-face Helmets (see below). They do not protect against shotgun pellets or anything higher-calibre than a handgun. Kevlar Vests can be worn inconspicuously underneath
      regular clothing, and will protect against shotgun pellets, but not anything higher-calibre than a handgun. Plate Carriers are bulky and cannot be worn
      inconspicuously, but protect against all firearms (at least all the ones that investigators are likely to encounter).</p>
      <p><strong>Open-face Helmets</strong>: If worn in conjunction with body armor, a helmet also imposes a -1 penalty to incoming attacks (that they would normally protect against). Open-face
      Helmets do not impose the -2 penalty to attacks reduced below 1 damage.</p>
      <p><strong>Full-face Helmets</strong>: If worn in conjunction with body armor, a helmet also imposes a -1 penalty to incoming attacks (that they would normally protect against). Full-face
      Helmets (like a motorcycle helmet) do impose the -2 penalty to attacks reduced below 1 damage, as normal. Additionally, they protect against spray weapons like pepper spray.</p>
      <p><strong>Shields</strong>: shield of any kind can be used in conjunction with other armor, but does not halve damage. Instead, it imposes a -2 penalty to all incoming attacks (except bullets). If
      the shield is bulletproof, it also provides Hard Cover, and thus a -2 penalty to incoming Firearms attack rolls which does not stack with other sources of Hard <a href="index.html#cover" class="keyword-link">Cover</a>.</p>
     <a href="#rules-compendium" class="back-link">↑ Back to top</a>
    </div>

    <div class="compendium-term" id="special-weapons">
     <h3>Special Weapons</h3>
     <p>Some weapons have other effects than simply dealing damage.</p>
     <p><strong>Pepper Spray</strong>: Pepper spray (or a similar weapon, like mace) ignores all armor except for helmets which cover the wearer's face. An attack with pepper spray may use either
        Close Combat or Firearms. Taking any damage from pepper spray forces the target to <em>immediately</em> make a Superficial Injury Roll, even if they have more than 1 Superficial
        HP. Regardless of success or failure, if any dice rolled for this attack shows a 1, then the spray <em>will also blow back into the user's face</em> and cause them 1 Superficial Damage
        (which also forces them to make an Injury Roll). This does not otherwise affect the result.</p>
      <p><strong>Brass Knuckles</strong>:Brass Knuckles and any other 'fist' weapon can be used with either the Close Combat or Athletics, not just Close Combat.</p>
      <p><strong>Electronic Control Device</strong>: This weapon launches two needles into the target to run an electric current through them. It is used with the Firearms skill, and has an effective
        range of about 15 feet.</p>
      <p><strong>Stun Gun</strong>: Despite being called a “gun,” this is actually a melee weapon, and is used with the Close Combat skill.</p>

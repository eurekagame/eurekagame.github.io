    <h1>Eureka Quick Reference</h1>
     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025.

  <h2>Firearm Attacks</h2>
  <p>
    Firearms in Eureka are extremely deadly. <em>A bullet always deals 4 Penetrative damage, enough to forcean Injury roll in just one shot, even from maximum HP.</em> However, they
    are difficult to hit with compared to many other systems, even when used by characters with a high Firearms Skill. <em>Attacks made with a firearm only hit on a Full Success.</em> 
    Instead of dealing half damage, Partial Successes - and Failures, for that matter - cause a Woo Roll (see below) to see what gets hit instead of the target.
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <p>
    <em>A single Basic Attack allows a character to fire a number of bullets with each gun they are holding equal to that gun's Rate of Fire. Each shot is rolled separately.</em>
    Using the Focus Eureka! Point ability on a firearm attack with multiple shots applies +2 to each roll instead of its normal effect. The attacker may choose up to as many targets 
    as they have shots. The targets are decided before rolls are made, and shots are split as evenly as possible between them. The attacker decides where any leftover 
    bullets are aimed (again, before rolls are made).
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <p>
    If 4 or more bullets are fired during a single Action, roll each shot with 1D12 instead of 2D6. Not only is this faster and easier, it also adds a greater degree of
    unpredictability, which better represents sustained automatic fire. When rolling 1D12, a 1 on the die is always a Failure and a 12 on the die is always a Full Success, regardless of
    modifiers.
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <h3>Taking Aim</h3>
  <p> A character can use an Action to Take Aim against a single target. This confers a +2 Contextual bonus to all shots in their next Basic
    Attack with a firearm against that target. This bonus does not apply if that Basic Attack has more than one target, or if anything at all happens
    that would interrupt their aim, such as Ducking, using Movements, or getting hit themselves.
  </p>
  <h3>Firearm Attack Penalties</h3>
  <p>
    Keeping one's aim steady can be difficult. Certain factors apply a flat penalty to Firearms attacks:
  </p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p><p><strong>Firing a gun while using 2 or more Movements to travel</strong>: -1 Penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>Target is fast-moving (e.g. using 2 or more Movements to travel)</strong>: -1 penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>Target is particularly fast (e.g. bird in flight)</strong>: -2 penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>Firing a gun one-handed</strong>: -1 penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>Firing with the off-hand</strong>: Additional -1 penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>Firing a long gun one-handed</strong>: Additional -2 penalty, negated if Athletics or Firearms bonus (including Traits) is +3 or higher.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Stabilization</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to the penalties above, there is a flat penalty for firing a large number of bullets during a single Action, as shown:
  </p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>More than one bullet</strong>: -1 penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>More than 3 bullets</strong>: Additional -1 penalty.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Several factors may add to the number of bullets a character can fire before incurring this penalty:</p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>The gun has a stock</strong>: +2 bullets.</p>
    <p><strong>Firearms bonus (including Traits) is +3 or higher</strong>: +2 bullets.</p>
    <p><strong>Athletics bonus (including Traits) is +3 or higher</strong>: +2 bullets.</p>
    <p><strong>Firearms bonus (including Traits) is +6 or higher</strong>: Additional +3 bullets.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Woo Roll</h3>
  <p>
    Projectiles that miss their targets do not just vanish into thin air, they have to hit something - the Woo Roll exists to determine what. <em>If an attack with a firearm is not a
    Full Success, a Woo Roll is made, which is a flat 1D6. If the shot was a Failure, subtract -2 from the Woo Roll's result</em> (making it more likely to hit something that
    does not benefit the shooter). If multiple bullets were fired, still just make a single Woo Roll, no matter how many shots missed. The results of the Woo Roll take effect
    after all shots from the attack are rolled. If the majority of them were Partial Successes, roll it normally. If the majority were Failures, apply the -2 penalty
  </p>
  <div class="para-break"></div>
  <p>
    The results of the Woo roll are as follows:
  </p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p>
      <strong>3 or higher (A "Positive Woo Roll)</strong>:  The shot hits something besides the intended target that somehow benefits the shooter (e.g. hitting a nearby fire
      extinguisher, spraying foam onto the bad guy and imposing a penalty to his next shot).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2 or lower (A "negative Woo Roll)</strong>: The shot hits something that does not benefit the shooter (e.g. hitting the hostage when they meant to hit the hostage-taker, or
      hitting a gas line and causing flammable gas to leak into the room).
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>Woo Rolls should affect obvious elements of the environment and situation first before they affect anything else. If and when a fight breaks out, GMs will first use elements
    that have been described in the narration as the basis for the results of Woo rolls. However, in the absence of these elements, the GM can roll on the Positive and Negative Woo
    tables starting on page 272 of the Eureka rulebook. If the target of the attack is using a vehicle, roll on the Positive and Negative Woo tables starting on page 274.
    A negative Woo table can cause a shooter to take up to 4 Penetrative Damage or break their gun if they're particularly unlucky.

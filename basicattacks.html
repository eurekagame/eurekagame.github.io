     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025.

<h2>Basic Attacks</h2>
  <p>
    Making a single attack takes an Action. If the only goal of the attack is to deal damage, the procedure is very simple, and uses the same 2D6 system as any other
    roll. Just make a roll using the relevant Skill (ex. Close Combat, Firearms, Athletics). Attacks do a flat amount of damage based on the weapon being used.
  </p>
  <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The attack hits and deals full damage.</p>
    <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The attack hits and deals half damage (rounding up). Firearms work differently, as detailed later. A Partial Success with a firearm does no damage, it
    instead calls for a Woo Roll.</p>
    <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The attack does no damage. With a firearm, this also calls for a Woo Roll.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <h3>Stealth Attacks</h3>
 <p>
    Any type of attack can be made as a Stealth Attack, as long as the target is within arm's reach and unaware or otherwise non-resisting. Stealth Attacks do not require dice rolls
    under most circumstances, and they bypass most forms of protection. They always deal at least 4 damage (of their usual type). If it makes sense, a Stealth Attack may even
    bypass HP entirely and kill the target outright (such as a point blank bullet to the back of the head).
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <p>
  <em>The target being “non-resisting” is key.</em> Normally, when a character makes any sort of attack, the reason a roll has to be made is because the target is assumed to be resisting
  somehow - throwing their arms up, wrestling for the weapon, trying to push the attacker away, or otherwise doing something to defend themselves. This even applies
  when an attack is coming from behind. The exact effects of a Stealth Attack and the protections it bypasses will be dependent on the situation. Follow the fiction: if the action being 
  described would logically bypass some protection (like Armor or the effect of a Trait), then it does. Otherwise, it doesn't. 
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <h2>Melee Attacks</h2>
 <p>
    Melee combat allows for a unique range of options in dealing with threats, but also calls for a few special considerations with regards to positioning and the physical attributes
    of the combatants. Below are the rules outlining contextual bonuses for particular situations in melee combat.
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <h3>Two-Handed Weapons</h3>
 <p>
  Some melee weapons require two hands to exert proper leverage. We don't list whether weapons require two hands to use, and trust you to make judgement calls on a
  case-by-case basis. If a character attempts a melee attack with a two-handed weapon using only one hand, the roll is made with a -2 penalty.
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <h3>Two-Weapon Fighting</h3>
 <p>
  By default, holding two melee weapons does not grant any extra attacks. <em>A single melee attack with either weapon takes 1 Action.</em> If a character makes a melee attack
  with a weapon held in their off-hand, that roll is made with a -2 penalty. That said, holding two melee weapons can provide a benefit to a trained character. We call the weapon 
  making the attack the Primary Weapon, and the other held weapon the Secondary Weapon.  The character can use the Secondary Weapon to constantly threaten their opponent, dividing 
  their opponent's attention and making it easier to strike past their defenses.
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <p>
  If the attacker has at least a +1 Skill rating in Close Combat (not a bonus from a Trait), and they are holding a one-handed Secondary Weapon, they may apply a
  Contextual bonus to all of their melee attack rolls made with the Primary Weapon. This bonus varies depending on the Secondary Weapon, as follows:
 </p>
 <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>1- or 2- Damage Weapon</strong>: +1 Contextual Bonus.</p>
    <p><strong>4- Damage Weapon</strong>: +2 Contextual Bonus.</p>
  </div>
 <h3>Weapon Length</h3>
 <p>
  Longer melee weapons keep the enemy at a distance. Melee attacks (including unarmed attacks) made against characters who are holding a longer melee weapon than the
  attacker are rolled with a penalty, as follows:
 </p>
 <div class="inset-box">
    <p><strong>Target's weapon is more than 6” longer than their attacker's</strong>: -1 Penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>Target's weapon is at least twice as long</strong>: additional -1 penalty.</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    An unarmed attack counts as a “weapon” which is 1” long. Neither of these rules apply unless the target's weapon is at least 10” in length. 
    Do not spend more than 30 seconds of real time determining how much longer one weapon is than another. This is a rule.
  </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <h3>Being Overwhelmed</h3>
 <p>
    It is hard enough to defend against one attacker, let alone three. If characters are outnumbered in a melee conflict, their opponents get a Contextual bonus to their
    melee attack rolls against them equal to their numeric advantage. For instance, if there are 4 attackers and 2 defenders, the attackers would get a +2 bonus; if there are 5
  attackers and 1 defender, the attackers get a +4 bonus. Only characters directly engaged in melee combat are counted for this purpose.
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <h3>Guarding</h3>
 <p>
   Naturally, if a character is aware of an attack, they are always attempting to guard or dodge in some way. This is why attacks require a roll in the first place. By Guarding,
   however, characters spend their Action to focus entirely on defense until their next Turn. <em>Melee attacks made against a Guarding target are made with a -1 penalty by default.</em>
   The more skilled the Guarding character is, the more effective their Guard. <em>Impose an additional penalty equivalent to their total positive Close Combat modifier.</em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>The benefit of Guarding will “decay” for each successive Turn that it is used.</em> For instance, a character using a Guard that normally imposes a -3 penalty will only impose
  a -2 penalty if they Guard again on their next Turn. This can be reduced to 0, but Guarding can never provide a bonus to incoming melee attacks.
  <em>Finally, if an unarmed character is Guarding against a melee weapon that does Penetrative Damage, cut the penalty imposed by Guarding in half, rounding down.</em>
  Remember, penalties are negative numbers. Halving -3 results in -1.5, which rounds down to -2.

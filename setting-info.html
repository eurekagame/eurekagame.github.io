      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

 <h2>Setting for E's Eureka Adventure</h2>
 <p>This Eureka adventure will take place in late-70s NYC (speficially the summer of 1977). Some of the players are extremely knowledgeable
    about dimensions of politics, music, sports, geography, while others may be less so. This is not a problem. For one thing, different people have
    different levels of awareness of all kinds of current events and pop culture. If you feel unprepared to  play an investigator with a different 
    level of knowledge than you (more OR less), don't! 
 </p>
 <div class="para-break"></div>
 <p>That said, there are some very basic phenomena that your investigators would be aware of. For the player in a rush, the two minimum required texts 
    are New York Style Magazine's 2015 article <a href="https://removepaywalls.com/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/t-magazine/1970s-new-york-history.html" 
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>"Why Can't We Stop Talking About New York in the Late 1970s?</strong></a> and this Wikipedia article section 
    titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_York_City_(1946%E2%80%931977)#Fiscal_crisis_of_1975" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Fiscal crisis of 1975</strong></a>.
    To avoid spoilers, read absolutely no further.
 </p>
 <p>
    <em>For those interested,</em> I have compiled a list of other interesting pieces of historical context that will give you a better sense of the time or 
    awareness of specific cultural phenomena. This list is an unhappy marriage between my instinct to recommend full book chapters, the available material easily found
    in today's google search engine, and the overwhelming racism and classism that characterizes both retrospective and then-current material. Inclusion is not 
    uncritical endorsement.

 <h3>Political Movements</h3>
 <p>The strength of radical identity movements waned in the late 1970s, largely as a result of infighting spurred by government espionage. 
    These articles are curated to illustrate both the decline and the recent past that any long-term residents would be aware of.</p>

 <h3>Youtube Playlist</h3>
 <p>
    <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKaMvaiYkT3BUSj783WIXhu-4YQ61HzuP&feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youtube Playlist</a> which includes concurrent 
    1970s footage, trailers and scenes from classic 70s NYC films, and clips illustrating the music of the time. The last video on this playlist is a long documentary, which you 
    should absolutely only watch if you are a nerd about this, and goes over some of the same material as the links. It's just really good. It also includes “spoilers” for events 
    that will occur during/after the campaign, but are not important to me to have “un-spoiled”, in large part because as it stands now some players already know them.

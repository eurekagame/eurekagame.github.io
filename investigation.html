      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

 <h2>Investigative Rolls</h2>
    <p>Investigative rolls are any rolls that aim to <em>directly</em> uncover some 
        piece of information that puts the investigators closer to solving the mystery. 
        For example, bypassing a keypad to a police evidence room is a <strong>Non-Investigative Roll</strong>, 
        finding a case file in the filing cabinet inside is an Investigative Roll.</p>
    <p class="para-break"></p>
    <p>Any skills can be used to investigate the mystery, but the GM ultimately 
        determines which skills are plausibly applicable in which circumstances. Failure gives 
        you investigation points, so there's no reason to only roll when you have an applicable skill 
        bonus or argue extensively about what constitutes a plausible skill.</p>
    <p class="para-break"></p>
    <p>Investigative rolls always grant some <strong>investigation points</strong>. On such a roll points are granted as follows:</p>
    <div class="inset-box">
      <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The investigator gains 1 <strong>Investigation Point</strong>, and learns all the information they can from their roll.</p>
      <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The investigator gains 2 <strong>Investigation Points</strong>, and learns something from the roll. They may only get part of a clue, or, rarely, an unexpected consequence may happen.</p>
      <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The investigator gains 3 <strong>Investigation Points</strong>, and does not figure out anythingâ€¦ yet. 
        However, remember that Failure and make a note of it on the character sheet; they might be able to use a <strong>Eureka! Point</strong> on it later.</p>
    </div>
 <h2>Eureka! Points</h2>
    <p>A <strong>Eureka! point</strong> is granted to a character who has achieved a sufficient number of <strong>Investigation Points</strong> 
        (15 in the default character playbook, with any extra rolling over). <strong>Eureka! points</strong> may be used for 
        particular traits, but all characters can use them to do the following:</p>
    <div class="inset-box">
       <p><strong>Eureka! Moment</strong>: Eureka! points can be spent to gain a piece of information that was lost on a previously failed <strong>Investigative Roll</strong> 
        (or a previous Partial Success that did not reveal all the information) of the player's choice so long as it was one made by their investigator. This also restores 
        1 point of <a href="index.html#composure" class="keyword-link"><strong>Composure</strong></a>.</p>
        <p class="para-break"></p>
        <p><strong>Focus</strong>: Eureka! points may also be used to add an additional d6 per Eureka! spent to a <strong>Non-Investigative Roll</strong> - then drop all 
            dice but the highest two. Use of a Eureka! point in this way must be declared before the dice are rolled. This roll still cannot be used to attempt a completely impossible outcome.</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Eureka! Moments</strong> require keeping careful notes on unresolved <strong>Investigative rolls</strong> so you can come back to them later - but at the same time, if your 
        investigator has learned the information related to the original roll another way, your GM may reveal an unplanned secret on the fly!</p>

    <h1>Eureka Quick Reference</h1>
     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025.
      </p>

    <h2>Chases</h2>
    <p>
        When the primary goal of at least one side of a conflict is escape - whether from hostile characters or from some time-sensitive hazard - we call this a chase. Speed is always
        going to be calculated in chases, because at least one person is trying to move as fast as they can. Chases mostly work exactly the same as any other situation where time is
        measured in Turns, but there are a couple unique considerations to bear in mind.
    </p>
    <h2>End Nodes</h2>
    <p>
        There might be no obvious line where someone “escapes” from their pursuers and totally loses them. Use this rule if a chase has no other concrete ending condition.
        First, decide on one or more End Nodes on the node map. Generally these will be at the edges of the map, and should lead into an area that changes the situation.
        <em>When a fleeing character makes it to an End Node, they can attempt to definitively escape as an Action:</em>
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
      <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: They definitely escape. They either lose their pursuers or are safe from a hazard.</p>
      <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: They do not escape, but can try again next Turn.</p>
      <p><strong>Failure</strong>: They do not escape, but can try again next Turn.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        If a pursuing character shares the End Node with a fleeing character, instead of the normal interactions that can occur from sharing a node, the pursuing character can
        attempt to catch their target as an Action.
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
      <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: They catch up with their target. They get a new full Turn (outside of Turn order), during which they are considered to be on the same node as their target.</p>
      <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: They do not catch up to their target, but can try again next Turn.</p>
      <p><strong>Failure</strong>: They do not catch up to their target, but can try again next Turn.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        For either party, this is a roll with the Skill used to calculate their Speed. They cannot make this roll if they have left the End Node at any point during this Turn.
        Regardless of the result, this Action immediately ends their Turn. These rolls at the End Node get an additional +1 Contextual bonus for each successive Turn they are
        attempted. So, the second attempt gets +1, the third attempt gets +2, and so on.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <h3>Obstacles</h3>
    <p>
        Obstacles add tension and interest to conflicts. They could be added any time action starts sprawling over a large area, but they are a necessary part of the action in chases.
        <em>It is up to the Narrator to determine where obstacles show up on the node map.</em> For a foot chase, obstacles should be present every 1D6+1 nodes. For a vehicle chase <em>in NYC</em>,
        obstacles should be present approximately every 1D12+5 nodes.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
        Sometimes characters can see an obstacle before they get to it, if it's something obvious like a huge wall. Other times it can be a sudden problem, like the floorboards breaking
        underneath a person's feet. Regardless, when a character enters a node with an obstacle, they must make a relevant Skill roll to somehow bypass the obstacle and
        continue moving. Just like anything else, characters are not forced to handle obstacles in a prescribed way. Clever thinking might negate the need to roll any dice at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a number of prewritten obstacle tables on Eureka handbook pages 306-325 with specific rules for overcoming them. However, 'generic' obstacles fall in two categories.
        If the obstacle could be passed without slowing down at all, such as a low fence, the results may look like this
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The obstacle may be passed with no extra Movements.</p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The obstacle may be passed at the cost of one extra Movement.</p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: This attempt costs one extra Movement, but does not pass the obstacle. Alternatively, they do pass the obstacle, but take damage or suffer another consequence
        in addition to the extra Movement cost.</p>
    </div>
    <p>If the obstacle could not reasonably be passed without slowing down, such as ajammed door that must be forced open, the results may look like this:</p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The obstacle may be passed at the cost of one extra Action.</p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The character's Turn immediately ends, but the obstacle may be passed freely next Turn.</p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: This attempt costs one extra Movement, but does not pass the obstacle. Alternatively, they do pass the obstacle, but take damage or suffer another consequence
        in addition to the extra Movement cost. The character's Turn immediately ends, making no progress towards passing the obstacle. They may try again on their next Turn.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Just like any other roll, characters can make Assistance rolls to help with obstacles as long as it would be feasible for them to do so. 
        Finally, characters may use an Action to create an obstacle behind them if they have the opportunity, such as by closing and locking a door, knocking over furniture,
        throwing a match on a puddle of gasoline, scattering marbles, or anything else that could reasonably hamper a pursuer.

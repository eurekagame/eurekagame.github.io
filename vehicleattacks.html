    <h1>Eureka Quick Reference</h1>
     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025.

    <h2>Vehicle Attacks</h2>
    <p>
        Vehicles can also double as weapons, as anyone who's been hit by a car can attest. <em>A character may attempt to ram someone with a motorized vehicle they are driving,
        which is rolled just like a Basic Attack, using Driving as the relevant Skill.</em> Any motorized vehicle used as a weapon in this way deals 4 Penetrative Damage, which is
        not reduced by Armor. Consider this to be a Melee Weapon attack for the purposes of Composure rolls. Any small motorized vehicle (e.g. a motorcycle or motor scooter) which hits a target in
        this way suffers the effects of a Major Crash (see below).
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>A driver may also attempt to attack a large moving creature or another moving vehicle, as long as they are sharing the same node or otherwise close enough to
    attempt this. An attempt at a "pit maneuver" or running someone off the road would be classified as a vehicle attack. Instead of being rolled like a normal Basic Attack, this calls for a
    contested roll: each party makes a Skill check; the attacker rolls Driving, and the defender rolls the most relevant Skill (usually Driving, but possibly Athletics). Each
    party adds a bonus to the roll based on the approximate size of their vehicle:</p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Motor Scooter</strong>: -3</p>
        <p><strong>Motorcycle</strong>: -2</p>
        <p><strong>Microcar</strong>: -1</p>
        <p><strong>Regular Car</strong>: +0</p>
        <p><strong>Pickup Truck or Van</strong>: +1</p>
        <p><strong>Box Truck</strong>: +2</p>
        <p><strong>Tractor Trailer</strong>: +3</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        If the attacker's result is higher than the target's, the target suffers a Minor Crash. If the attacker's result is higher than the targetâ€™s by 5 or more, the target suffers a Major
        Crash. The attacker is also at risk: If the attacker's total result is 9 or below, they will suffer a Minor Crash. 6 or below, and they will suffer a Major Crash.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <h3>Vehicle Crashes</h3>
    <p>
        There are two types of crashes, Minor Crashes, and Major Crashes. Both types of crashes deal damage to all of the vehicle's occupants, as listed below:
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Minor Crash (Manual Vehicle)</strong>: 1 Superficial Damage.</p>
        <p><strong>Minor Crash (Motorized Vehicle)</strong>: 2 Superficial Damage.</p>
        <p><strong>Major Crash (Manual Vehicle)</strong>: 8 Superficial Damage.</p>
        <p><strong>Major Crash (Motorized Vehicle)</strong>: 8 Penetrative Damage.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Minor crashes leave the vehicle visibly damaged, but operable. A Major Crash immediately ends the Turn for every character inside and renders the vehicle
        inoperable. Crashes can result from vehicle attacks, obstacles, or any other situation that would reasonably cause damage to a vehicle's occupants 
    </p>
    <p>The damage from crashes can be increased or decreased under certain circumstances:</p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Motorized vehicle is not enclosed</strong>: Double damage.</p>
        <p>Do not apply this if the rider is wearing armor.</p>
        <p><strong>Wearing a helmet</strong>: half damage (rounded down)</p>
        <p><strong>Wearing a seatbelt</strong>: half damage (rounded down)</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Armor does not protect against damage from crashes in any other circumstances. If a character is wearing a helmet and a seatbelt, the benefits stack (reducing damage to one
        quarter). However, a seatbelt imposes a -2 penalty to anything that would reasonably be hindered by decreased mobility, such as aiming a gun or administering first aid.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <h3>Damage to Vehicles</h3>
    <p>
        Vehicles in Eureka do not have HP. They continue to function until they are involved in a Major Crash, at which point they are considered unusable. That said, there are a handful
        of negative effects which can be applied to them, usually as a result of Woo Rolls from being shot at or hitting some kind of obstacle in a chase:
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Punctured Tire</strong>: For every 25% of the tires on a vehicle punctured or otherwise damaged, impose a -1 penalty to all Driving checks.</p>
        <p><strong>Severed Break Line</strong>: Vehicle can no-longer be stopped or slowed at will.</p>
        <p><strong>Shattered Windshield</strong>: For each instance of the windshield being damaged, apply a -1 penalty to Senses rolls made by any character in the vehicle.</p>
        <p><strong>Destroyed Steering Mechanism</strong>: Any Driving check automatically fails.</p>
        <p><strong>Punctured Fuel Tank</strong>: Narrator rolls 3D12. The result is how many rounds a motor vehicle can continue to run before the fuel tank empties. Each time the fuel tank
        is punctured afterwards, divide this number by 2, rounding up.</p>
        <p><strong>Destroyed Engine Block</strong>: Vehicle is considered destroyed, even without a Major Crash.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Jousting</h3>
    <p>
        If a melee Basic Attack is performed against a target moving at an extremely different velocity, double the melee weapon's damage but apply a -1 penalty to the attack roll.
        In general, the kind of speed required to actually apply this rule will require some kind of vehicle and will not be achievable on foot.

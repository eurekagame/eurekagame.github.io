      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

 <h2>Heat</h2>
    <p>“Heat” represents the degree to which an investigator's actions have attracted the attention of law enforcement.
        The Narrator will track a hidden Heat score separately for each investigator. At the beginning of an adventure, 
        it is set based on the investigator's Wealth stat. An investigator will never start the adventure with Heat below 
        -6 or above 0, no matter how high or low an investigator's Wealth is.
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong> -3 Wealth</strong>: 0 starting Heat </p>
        <p><strong> -2 Wealth</strong>: -1 starting Heat </p>
        <p><strong> -1 Wealth</strong>: -2 starting Heat </p>
        <p><strong> 0 Wealth</strong>: -3 starting Heat </p>
        <p><strong> +1 Wealth</strong>: -4 starting Heat </p>
        <p><strong> +2 Wealth</strong>: -5 starting Heat </p>
        <p><strong> +3 Wealth</strong>: -6 starting Heat </p>
    </div>
    <p>So long as an investigator does not have a warrant out for their arrest, their Heat will decrease by -1 each day, 
        to a minimum of -3. If the players' investigation targets a high-profile official or member of law enforcement, however,
        Heat will not decrease for the duration of the adventure.</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>Even if the investigator is anonymous or has covered their tracks, Heat can still rise, representing an investigation 
        into their crimes or an ongoing manhunt for someone fitting their description. Detailed below are the ways in which Heat 
        can increase. Multiple of these factors can be true of a single instance of raising Heat, and if so, then all of them “stack.”</p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Getting visibly involved in or interfering with a police investigation (for example, asking suspicious questions, 
            making a request to view evidence, or attempting to investigate a crime scene while police are present): <strong>+1 Heat</strong></li>
            <li>Committing a crime that leaves any evidence whatsoever that a crime has been committed, even if there is nothing linking 
            the investigator to the crime: <strong>+1 Heat</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the crime is a violent crime: an additional <strong>+1 Heat</strong></li>
                    <li>If the crime would garner special attention, such as a crime against a celebrity, police officer, government official, 
                        or the theft or destruction of something extremely valuable: an additional <strong>+1 Heat</strong></li>
                </ul>
            <li>Leaving <strong>identifying evidence</strong> at a crime scene, such as fingerprints, hairs, shoe prints, camera footage, etc.: 
                <strong>+1 Heat</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the evidence is <strong>positively identifying</strong>: an additional <strong>+1 Heat</strong></li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>When we say “evidence,” we mean anything that would reasonably lead authorities to suspect foul play or that a crime has been 
        committed. A person being reported missing will not necessarily increase Heat, but their body being found certainly would. </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p><strong>“Identifying evidence”</strong> includes things such as fingerprints, hair, shoe prints, bullets, shell casings, etc. It also includes 
        recordings that depict the investigator's height, weight, build, voice, etc., but not their face or any positively identifying features.
        Just investigating a crime scene is sufficient - interfering with a crime scene is itself a crime.</p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p><strong>“Positively identifying evidence”</strong> includes personal belongings that definitively link back to a specific person, such as an ID, a firearm 
        registered to the investigator, or recordings that show the investigator's face (or other identifying features such as distinctive scars, tattoos, etc.)</p>
 <h2>Law Enforcement Calls and Responses</h2>
        <p>
            Bystanders may directly call the police regarding investigators. Investigators should be cautious about causing scenes or committing crimes where 
            witnesses can see. It will be obvious in many circumstances if particular witnesses would call the police. If the Investigators threaten or annoy a 
            bystander, they will likely report what they've seen to the authorities. If a witness is a friend of an Investigator, or was the victim of a 
            supernatural crime, they likely won't make a report.</p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p>If there is any uncertainty whether police will be called, the Narrator can roll 1d6 and add a flat modifier based on the table of suspicious activities below.
            On a 6+, the police will get a call about the situation. If police are called on an investigator, then immediately add the relevant modifier below to the 
            investigator's Heat, even if no dice roll was made. This can stack with positively identifying evidence left at the scene of the crime as described above.</p>
        <div class="inset-box">
            <ul class="list">
                <li> Something not illegal, but potentially “suspicious,” such as parking for long periods of time near someone's house: <strong>+1</strong></li>
                <li>Something illegal, but not violent or dangerous, such as trespassing on private property: <strong>+2</strong></li>
                <li>Something illegal and violent or dangerous, such as brandishing weapons or physical confrontation: <strong>+3</strong></li>
                <li>Something extremely high-profile, mass destruction (e.g. shooting into a crowd or planting a bomb): <strong>+5</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>When the police get a call about an investigator or investigators, roll 2D6+[Heat]. Use the highest Heat out of the investigators present at the scene. Even if 
            there is no call, make the Heat roll any time an investigator's Heat increases by 3 or more in a single scene.</p>
        <div class="inset-box">
            <p><strong>On a 6 or below,</strong>the police don't do anything at all about it.</p>
            <p><strong>On a 7-9</strong>, the police will send a squad car out to ride around the area and question anyone they think looks suspicious. The car will arrive at 
                the location in 1 Tick. If they are responding to an ongoing fight or disturbance where time is being measured in rounds, then the car will arrive in 1D6+4 rounds.</p>
                <p>If this is not a response to a specific phone call, instead, 1D6 days later an officer or detective is sent out to track down and interview the investigator, 
                    as they are considered a suspect.</p>
            <p><strong>On a 10-13</strong>, the police will send 1D6+1+[Heat] officers (minimum one officer) in squad cars to the location in 1 Tick with the 
                intent to arrest persons matching the investigator(s) description. If they are responding to an ongoing fight or disturbance where time is being measured 
                in rounds, then the car will arrive in 1D6+2 rounds. 
                <em>For the rest of the mystery, there will be a warrant out for the investigator(s)' arrest, and their Heat will no-longer decrease. </em></p>
            <p>If this is not a response to a specific phone call, the warrant will be put out for their arrest, but police will not immediately start actively hunting down the 
                investigator. However, going forward, if officers interact with the investigators, they may search their name or license plate on the police database, find 
                that they have a warrant, and then arrest them. </p>
            <p><strong>On a 14+</strong>, treat this as a 10-13, and also add a Specialized Response with non-standard police officers (ex. SWAT, K-9 units, helicopters).</p>
            <p>If this is not a response to a specific phone call, then treat this as initiating an active manhunt for the investigator or someone matching their description. </p>
        </div>
        <p>Investigators that draw too much Heat are likely to end up arrested. Depending on the charges, authorities may or may not set bail. If the investigator is 
            allowed bail, a <strong>Full Success</strong> on a Wealth check could get them out of jail pending trial. The Heat of an investigator who is out on bail will not decrease, 
            and any additional arrest will render them inelligible for bail.</p>

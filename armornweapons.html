    <h1>Eureka Quick Reference</h1>
     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

<section class="main-section">
    <h2>Armor</h2>
    <p>
        Wearing protective clothing or equipment can reduce incoming damage. <em>Armor of any kind halves damage from most sources of damage <strong>except bullets</strong></em>.
        If an instance of damage would be reduced below 1, instead apply a -2 penalty to the attack roll that would cause that damage. <em>Unless stated
        otherwise, worn armor is always mechanically in effect, even if an attacker is trying to avoid it or aim around it.</em>
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
      That said, there are some rare circumstances where it wouldn't make any sense for armor to apply. If one character sneaks up on another,
      puts a gun directly to their skull, and pulls the trigger, then wearing a bulletproof vest isn't going to help. Consider the situation carefully, and if anything is unclear, err on the side of armor working normally.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
    <p>
      Any worn item that could sufficiently impede damage being done to a character counts as armor. See the item lists on the <a href="inventory.html" class="keyword-link">Inventory</a> page.
      <em>Unless stated otherwise, damage cannot be halved by armor twice</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Some particularly high-quality or specialized armor has special attributes which grant additional situational protection. For more information on
      items like Bulletproof Armor, Helmets, and Shields, see <a href="index.html#special-armor" class="keyword-link">Special Armor</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Weapons</h2>
    <p>If a weapon isn't listed here, use these values as a guideline. Generally, human-scale weapons should deal 1, 2, or 4 damage. Firearms work differently than other weapons. Bullets
      always deal 4 Penetrative Damage, and they only hit on a Full Success, plus a number of other differences to consider,
      which are listed on the <a href="firearmattacks.html" class="keyword-link">Firearm Attacks</a> page.
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
      <p><strong>1 Superficial Damage</strong>: Fist, Foot, Human Teeth.</p>
      <p><strong>1 Penetrative Damage</strong>: Pocket Knife, Switchblade, Brass Knuckles, Bobcat's Claws</p>
      <p><strong>2 Superficial Damage</strong>: Melee Strike with Gun, Blackjack, Shield Bash, Stun Gun, Pepper Spray</p>
      <p><strong>2 Penetrative Damage</strong>: Short Lead Pipe, Machete, Kitchen Knife, Doberman's Teeth, Hatchet, Hammer, Bear's Claws</p>
      <p><strong>4 Superficial Damage</strong>: Electronic Control Device, Rubber Bullet</p>
      <p><strong>4 Penetrative Damage</strong>: Knightly Sword, Infantry Spear, Fireaxe, Baseball Bat, Long Lead Pipe, Bullet, Crocodile Bite</p>
    </div>
    <p>Some particularly high-quality or specialized weapons have special attributes which grant additional situational advantages. For more information on 
      items like Pepper Spray, Brass Knuckles, and Stun Guns, see <a href="index.html#special-weapons" class="keyword-link">Special Weapons</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Explosives</h2>
    <p>Broadly, Eureka defines four categories of explosives. These aren't precise categories, and the rules presented should be used as guidelines if something unusual comes up.
      Each entry will list an example of that category, the blast radius of the explosive, the damage it deals, and then any special properties.
    </p>
    <div class="para-break"></div>
      <h4>Shrapnel (Ex: most improvised bombs, e.g. pipe bomb)</h4>
      <p><strong>Radius</strong>: 20 yards. <strong>Damage</strong>: 4 Penetrative</p>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
      <p>
        Shrapnel explosives do most of their damage through bits of flying debris propelled by the explosion. Shrapnel explosives still have an element of concussive force to them, but 
        do not create a powerful enough shockwave to kill a person outright
      </p>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
      <h4>Concussive (Ex: hand grenade, C4)</h4>
      <p><strong>Radius</strong>: 6 yards (Kill) 18 yards (Wound). <strong>Damage</strong>: 16 (Kill) or 8 (Wound) Penetrative.</p>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
      <p>
        These weapons have two blast radiuses. Within the first blast radius (the kill radius), they deal 16 Penetrative Damage. Within the second radius (the wound radius), they deal
        8 Penetrative Damage. Conventional body armor does not provide any protection against damage within either radius. Most military-grade explosives fall into this category, and within the blast
        radius there is virtually nothing that can be done to survive the shockwave. If investigators start encountering these, they are in way, way over their heads!
      </p>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
      <h4>Splash (Ex: Molotov cocktail)</h4>
      <p><strong>Radius</strong>: 2 yards. <strong>Damage</strong>: 2 Superficial per round.</p>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
      <p>
        Affected characters take 2 Superficial Damage per Round at the end of their own Turn, until they either extinguish themselves or otherwise remove the substance from their
        body. <a href="index.html#ducking" class="keyword-link">Ducking</a> has no effect on the damage of these explosives, but Ducking can be used to throw oneself to the ground and roll to extinguish flames.
        A splash explosion is anything that covers its radius and targets within it in some kind of harmful substance, such as burning gasoline, powerful acid, or toxic gas.
      </p>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
      <h4>Stun Grenade (Ex: Flashbang)</h4>
      <p><strong>Radius</strong>: 7 yards. <strong>Damage</strong>: Variable, up to 2 Superficial.</p>
      <div class="para-break"></div>
      <p>
        A stun grenade utilizes a blinding flash of light and a deafening noise to subdue targets. A character that is within 2 yards of a flashbang grenade will suffer 2 Superficial
        Damage from the shower of fire and sparks it produces. Additionally, all characters within the radius must make a Senses roll:
      </p>
      <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: For 3 Rounds, the character takes a -3 penalty to all Skill rolls, and anyone attacking them gets a +3 to their own attack rolls. Additionally, the character 
          immediately takes a temporary <a href="index.html#grevious-wounds" class="keyword-link">Grievous Wound</a> to Both Eyes or Both Ears (whichever seems most reasonable). This will not be
          applied if the character hasn't taken any Superficial Damage.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: or 2 Rounds, the character takes a -3 penalty to all Skill rolls, and anyone attacking them gets a +2 to their own attack rolls. Additionally, the
          character immediately takes a temporary Grievous Wound to Both Eyes or Both Ears (whichever seems most reasonable).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: For 1 Round, the character takes a -3 penalty to all Skill rolls, and anyone attacking them gets a +1 to their own attack rolls.
        </p>

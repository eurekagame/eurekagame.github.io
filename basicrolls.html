    <h1>Eureka Quick Reference</h1>
     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

 <h2>Basic Rolls</h2>
    <p>To make a check in Eureka, add the results of rolling 2d6 and the relevant <strong>modifier</strong>. The success of the roll is determined as follows:</p>
    <div class="inset-box">
      <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: A 10+ on the roll. The character achieves the intended result of their roll without negative consequences.</p>
      <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: 7-9 on the roll. The character achieves their intended results but with consequences or less than intended effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Failure</strong>: 6 or lower. The attempt fails.</p>
    </div>
    <p> In the event of partial successes and failures, depending on the context, 
        consequences may in the fiction be portrayed as a result of bad luck or a failure 
        of character skill. If a player's character is an expert hacker, it might feel 
        better to hear their investigator failed a tech check due to a power outage than 
        a coding bug. Players are encouraged to contribute to the GM's ultimate ruling on 
        both the mechanical and narrative effects of partial successes and failures.</p>

 <h2> <a href="index.html#modifiers" class="keyword-link">Modifiers</a></h2>
    <p>There are two types of positive modifiers in Eureka: <strong>base</strong> and <strong>contextual</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Base</strong> modifiers represent an investigator's natural skill and comes from <a href="index.html#skills" class="keyword-link"><strong>skills</strong></a> or 
        traits on the investigator's character sheet. 
        <em>The sum of all Base modifiers and penalties on a given roll cannot exceed an investigator's current Composure.</em></p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p><strong>Contextual</strong> modifiers apply in certain contexts <em>as defined by the rulebook</em>, 
        like shooting a gun from a long distance or making an investigation check while wounded.</p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p>Your character may also have negative modifiers, called penalties, which are reflected in skills and 
            traits and are subtracted from base modifiers <em>before composure is considered</em>.</p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
       <p>For an individual roll, the result is always calculated with the following method:</p>
       <div class="inset-box">
         <p>1. Roll 2d6 and compute the sum.</p>
         <p>2. Evaluate the sum of only <strong>base</strong> and negative modifiers. Compare this value to the 
         <a href="index.html#composure" class="keyword-link"><strong>Composure</strong></a> skill. If higher, reduce the value 
         to the investigator's Composure score. <em>Only now is the result of this step added to the sum from step 1.</em></p>
         <p>3. Add any contextual modifiers to the roll for your final result</p>
       </div>
 <h2>Assisting with Rolls</h2>
    <p>Characters can help one another with some rolls in <em>some circumstances</em>. Assists should almost never be used for 
        <a href="index.html#composure" class="keyword-link"><strong>Composure</strong></a>, <strong>Attack</strong>,  <a href="index.html#speed-rolls" class="keyword-link"><strong>Speed</strong></a>, and 
        <a href="index.html#injury-rolls" class="keyword-link"><strong>Injury</strong></a> rolls. They should rarely be used for 
        <a href="index.html#investigation" class="keyword-link"><strong>Investigation</strong></a> rolls. An assist roll is reserved for situations where a character can 
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: +2 Contextual modifier to the Main Roll.</p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: +1 Contextual modifier to the Main Roll.</p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: -2 penalty to the main roll.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="para-break"></div>
     <p>More than one investigator can roll to assist with a Main Roll, but the GM can use discretion when determining if additional assists would help.</p>
     <p>In the event an investigator can assist with an <strong>Investigation</strong> roll, 
        the assisting character also earns <a href="index.html#investigation" class="keyword-link"><strong>Investigation Points</strong></a>.</p>

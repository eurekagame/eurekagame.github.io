     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

 <h2>Character Health</h2>
    <p>Hit Points (HP) represent a character's physical condition. Characters have 
    two separate types of HP: <strong>Superficial</strong> and <strong>Penetrative</strong>.
    <p><strong>Superficial HP</strong> is affected by damage on the surface like bruises, burns,
    and shallow cuts. Fists, fire, and just about anything that isn't immediately life-threatening
    cause Superficial Damage.Guns, knives, baseball bats, and serious car crashes cause Penetrative Damage.</p>
    <p><strong>Penetrative HP</strong> is affected by damage that breaks bones, punctures organs, 
        and rends flesh. </p>
    <p class="para-break"></p>
     <p>Any Superficial Damage past 0 <strong>Superficial HP</strong> “spills over” into <strong>Penetrative HP</strong>. Any 
        character reduced to 0 Penetrative HP dies immediately. </p>
 <h2>The Injury Roll</h2>
    <p>When a character is reduced to 1 <strong>Superficial HP</strong>, when reduced to 0 Superficial HP, and any time 
        they take any kind of damage while at 0 Superficial HP, they must make an Athletics roll to determine the severity of their injury </p>    
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: The character does not gain a status, though of course having
        low HP is a problem of its own. </p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: The character gains the Superficial Injury status. Then, roll 1d6. 
            If the die lands on a 6, the character recieves a <a href="index.html#grevious-wounds" class="keyword-link"><strong>Grievous Wound</strong></a>. </p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: The character gains the Superficial Incapacitation status. Then, roll 1d6. 
        If the die lands on 6, the character receives a <a href="index.html#grevious-wounds" class="keyword-link"><strong>Grievous Wound</strong></a>. 
        If the die lands on 1, the character falls unconscious.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para-break"></p>
        <p>When a character is reduced to 1 Penetrative HP, they also must make an Athletics/Injury roll. 
            Statuses are Penetrative instead of Superficial, and any Grievous Wounds are permanent instead of temporary.</p>
    <p class="para-break"></p>
        <p>An Investigator's character sheet has four boxes, one for each status (Superficial Injury, Superficial Incapacitation, 
            Penetrative Injury, and Penetrative Incapacitation) <em>These statuses can stack.</em> An investigator can hypothetically 
            have all four at once. Sounds like a bad day!</p>
    <p class="para-break"></p>
        <p>A character with the <strong>Injury</strong> status takes a -2 penalty to all rolls (except Wealth rolls).</p>
        <p>A character with the Incapacitation status (of either type) will be capable of at most 1 Speed and will make all rolls with 1d6
            instead of 2d6. A 1 is still considered a Failure regardless of modifiers, but a 6 is not an automatic Full Success. </p>
    <p class="para-break"></p>
        <p><strong>The Injury and Incapacitation statuses are removed when the matching type of HP is fully restored.</strong></p>
    <p class="para-break"></p>
        <p>If a character has both the Superficial and Penetrative Incapacitation statuses, they are treated as being <strong>unconscious</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Unconscious</strong> characters cannot act. Unconciousness lasts until the end of the scene or for 1 Tick depending on the circumstances.
            Characters are likely in fiction not unconcious for minutes at a time - the status can represent shock, trauma, delirium, or other reasons why your investigator
            might be non-functional.</p>
 <h2>Grevious Wounds</h2>
    <p>A Grievous Wound is any kind of disabling wound that would have a specific lasting
    effect on a part of the body. When a character is injured and takes a Grevious Wound, <em>the Narrator decides what kind of Grievous Wound a
    character takes</em>, based on what kind of weapon is doing the damage, where it hit, and what they think would be most interesting for the situation at hand </p>
    <p class="para-break"></p>
    <p>If the status that caused the Grievous Wound is <strong>Superficial</strong>, then the Grievous Wound is temporary. The effects cease when the status is removed. However, if the
    status that caused the Grievous Wound is <strong>Penetrative</strong>, then the Grievous Wound is permanent. The character has to live with it forever. If a body part that was already
    currently suffering a temporary Grievous Wound takes a second Grievous Wound, that Grievous Wound becomes permanent. </p>
    <p class="para-break"></p>
    <p>Depending on the time period or tech level of the campaign, a character may be able to get a prosthetic or physical therapy to mitigate the effects of a permanent Grievous
    Wound, though this will usually have to happen in between adventures. </p>
 <h2>Health</h2>
    <p>Under normal circumstances, characters recover 1 point of <strong>Superficial HP</strong> the morning after a night of rest, but <strong>Penetrative HP</strong> 
        must be restored by either a Medicine roll or long-term medical care</p>
    <h3>The Medicine Roll</h3>
        <p class ="para-break"></p>
    <p>Different types of HP are tracked separately: a character must declare what they are restoring
        before they roll. Characters may only make a Medicine Roll on one given investigator per scene. Once an investigator has regained a given type of HP from a Medicine roll, 
        they must lose a point of that same HP before another Medicine roll can be made to restore that type of HP.</p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: 2 HP restored.</p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: 1 HP restored.</p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: No HP restored.</p>
    </div>
    <p> Characters may only make this type of Medicine roll on a given investigator once per Scene, per type of HP. Once an investigator has regained a given type 
        of HP from a Medicine roll, they must lose a point of that same HP before another Medicine roll can be made to restore that type of HP.</p>
    <h3>Medical Facilities & Long-Term Care</h3>
    <p>When a character visits a medical facility, they can receive immediate care, long-term care, or both. Medical facilities fall into three categories: 
        hospitals, clinics, and “back-alley.” </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Hospital</strong>: Full-service facilities. +4 Medicine.[1] Can provide immediate and long-term care. No bonus or penalty to the Wealth roll (see below). 
            Will report gunshots, stab wounds, etc. to the authorities </p>
        <p><strong>Clinic</strong>: Outpatient and minor emergency facilities. +3 Medicine. Can only provide immediate care. +2 Contextual bonus to the Wealth roll. 
            May report gunshots, stab wounds, etc. to the authorities. </p>
        <p><strong>'Back-Alley'</strong>: Unregistered, unlicensed, illegal, or otherwise “under-the-table” facilities. +3 Medicine. Can provide immediate and 
            long-term care. No bonus or penalty to the Wealth roll. Will not report anything to the authorities.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Even finding a “back-alley” facility can be tricky, they don't exactly advertise. A character attempting to find one will have to ask dodgy questions or make a Full 
        Success on a reversed Wealth roll, unless there is some other obvious reason the character would have access to one.</p>
    <h3>The Wealth Roll</h3>
    <p>Regardless of the type of care, it's not free. An investigator who needs to pay for medical care will need to make a Wealth roll to afford it, before benefitting 
        from either form of treatment.</p>
     <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>Full Success</strong>: They can afford medical treatment without issue.</p>
        <p><strong>Partial Success</strong>: They can afford medical treatment, but it's a hit to the wallet, and they must make a Poverty Composure roll.</p>
        <p><strong>Failure</strong>: They must take on medical debt to afford treatment. They must make a Poverty Composure roll, and take a -2 penalty to 
            Wealth for the remainder of the adventure.</p>
    </div>
    <p>After the roll is made, a character may decline medical treatment, choosing to forgo the Composure roll and any medical debt</p>
    <p>For immediate medical care, the Narrator makes a Medicine roll for the facility. <em>This works exactly like a Medicine roll made by another character, following all
         of the same guidelines.</em> For long-term care, a character has a chance to restore HP (of both types) every day.</p>

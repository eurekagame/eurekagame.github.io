    <h1>Eureka Quick Reference</h1>
     <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Based on the work of the creators of Lancer's Quick Reference Rules, 
        here's all the most important information contained in the sprawling 
        700-page <em>Eureka</em> rulebook, as of summer 2025. Clinking on any 
        of the in-text hyperlinks will send you to our complete rule compendium
        with examples and play advice straight from the rulebook.

    <h2>Inventory</h2>
    <p>
        An investigator's inventory represents the items in their possession. How much an investigator can carry is meant to be played by ear, as there are no specific encumbrance
        limits or item weights in Eureka. Carrying what would clearly be an exceptionally heavy load, however, may require an Athletics roll. There are three types of inventory:
    </p>
    <div class="inset-box">
        <p><strong>On-Person</strong>: Items carried on the investigator's person, such as in pockets, a backpack, in their hands, etc</p>
        <p><strong>Secured:</strong>Items owned but left in a location normally only accessible to the investigator. Possessions that are these other locations also count as secured inventory.</p>
        <div class="category-description">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home Secured</strong>: An investigators home and the items therein.</li>
                <li><strong>Vehicle Secured</strong>: An investigators vehicle and the items therein.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
        <p><strong>Unsecured</strong>: Items that investigators know the location of but that are not reliably in their possession in any real way.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Just because an item is in the On-Person or Secured inventory does not mean it is literally perfectly “secure.” A character can be pickpocketed, or something might be
        stolen out of their vehicle in a rough neighborhood, but barring circumstances like these, the character should be able to reasonably access those items.
    </p>
    <h3>Wealth Points</h3>
        <p>
            As the last step of character creation, players will roll for their investigators' Wealth Points (WP). Rather than tracking item purchases dollar by dollar, Wealth Points are an
            abstract way of measuring an investigator's finances at the start of the adventure. Unlike other aspects of a character sheet (which may or may not change), an
            investigator's starting inventory items are always wiped clean at the start of a new adventure. An investigator's starting
            items do not represent the sum of all their worldly possessions, just the ones they unquestionably have access to at the start of the adventure.
        </p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p>
            <em>To determine an investigator's Wealth Points, roll 3D6+6+(Wealthx2). The result is their total budget of Wealth Points.</em> Players can add items from the lists below to
            their investigators' inventories, spending the listed number of WP. Wealth Points are not a resource used or tracked during gameplay, they are only used during character
            creation. (Although the listed WP cost of an item does influence a Wealth roll made to purchase an item during play.)
        </p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p>
            Items of little consequence such as wallets, basic clothing, handkerchiefs, and so on are considered to have 0WP cost when determining inventory. 
            During play, if it makes sense for a character to have something like this, but it's not directly listed on their sheet, it's
            usually fine to just say they have it anyway. Use your best judgement: an investigator having alcohol wipes in their purse to clean up after a picnic shouldn't call for a Wealth
            roll, but suddenly having alcohol pads to clean up after leaving an incriminating blood spatter at a crime scene might. Finally, just because any investigator can be armed, doesn't mean they should be.
            Consider whether the investigator would actually be the type to own or carry a weapon.
        </p>
    <h3>Item Lists</h3>
        <p>
            This is by no means an exhaustive list of all items that can be obtained in Eureka, but it can be used as a reference to come up with an appropriate Wealth Point cost for any item that isn't listed.
            Don't forget to give them a means of transportation, a food budget, and especially a home. 
        </p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
        <p>
            Secured Inventories (whether they be vehicles, or especially homes) generally come furnished with a great deal of extra stuff that the investigator might logically own or
            have access to. It can be appropriate to say that an investigator might have some useful item lying around. Vehicles
            and homes have what's called a <strong>Property Modifier (PM)</strong>, which broadly represents the plausible range of items that might be found or stored within. The <strong>Property Modifier</strong>
            will be listed next to each home and vehicle. <em>When making a Wealth roll to check if the investigator already has an item in a particular Secured Inventory, also apply the
            Property Modifier to the roll.</em> This makes it so that a potentially useful item is more likely to be squirreled away in a closet of a middle class home than attached to a bicycle.
        </p>
        <div class="para-break"></div>
        <h4>Animals</h4>
        <p>
            These costs include food and basic care requirements. We leave the details of animal ownership (as well as the exact lines between a "small," "medium," and "large" animal) up to you.
        </p>

        <div class="para-break"></div>
        <h4>Armor</h4>
        <p>
            Most armor will protect against melee weapons. Only bulletproof armor and military helmets will protect against firearms.

        <div class="para-break"></div>

        <p>
            All firearms come with one empty magazine (internal or external). To load it, ammunition must also be purchased.
